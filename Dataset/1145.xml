	<body>This time Javier Fesser's brother William, in the production of the film (Javier, not William, that I mess), composed a film that still drinking from the sources of the Fesser is a tragi-comedy, hard, acidic and very fun, where presented us the life of a woman made if same, beginning to end.Tremendous interpretation of Candida, without knowing just read, interprets masterfully a role based on his own life, accompanying the typical side that we are accustomed to seeing on television, especially to Jorge Bosch.La film is divided into two parts, mainly separated by a touch that sometimes clears the genius (the principle, fast, fun, cool), with a very almibarado ending that seems that we find ourselves in a "reality".Even so, always you can say that "I liked more the book" right? ALE, now all to buy "Candida, memoirs of an Assistant: when God presses, drowns but good".</body>
