	<body>Michael Clayton is a "Troubleshooter". Nice euphemism to nominate anyone who undertakes to solve all the desaguisados that have to do with lawyers. You can already ask an arms licence or to buy you a Peruvian child, probably the only one who can do it. Michael Clayton is the vehicle for the showcasing of George Clooney. It is not bad given that it is one of the most charming of the screens and leads to mass cinema either to see one action or to witness dialécticas skirmishes of tapes as the before us. He interprets this peculiar character that adds his stressful work a personal and economic crisis worrying dimensions and just the worst time that you can imagine because without knowing it when it comes to helping a friend is gotten up to eyebrows into a multinational intrigue to conceal a crime of poisoning by metals in the hands of UNortha major company whose law firm is more scary than the same demon.A couple of deaths, an explosion in time and a fairly predictable speech complete this thriller legal tint which is in the middle of the genre films but not excels in any aspect. A cocktail between Civil action and Erin Brokovich that really nothing happens during most of the time (is an achievement to keep entertaining nearly two hours of footage if you think well). A bit disappointing though truly Orthodox and correct (and, precisely for this reason, boring).</body>
