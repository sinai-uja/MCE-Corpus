	<summary>Baxter sees the world as it is cruel and inhumane, behaving in the same way.</summary>
	<body>Anyone think that this is the film seen on several occasions with dog, either family film "LASSIE, partners and Hounds" or terror as CUJO, ROTWEILLER".Nothing to do because here the shots go by completely opposite destinations in a fable that humanizes the dog protagonist becoming one human being again.We are seeing from the drama, comedy or classical cinema of horror to animal emotions transmitted from smiles to tears through hatred.Because BAXTER sees the world as it is cruel and inhumane, behaving in the same form. Each family bring new emotions, feeling us witnesses every word thanks to a script with iron fist, a masterpiece of a hardness that shocked, that you catch in this spiral of characters to the limit, with a bottom that you stuck hopeless forever.Inexplicably director end lost by not returning to work.</body>
