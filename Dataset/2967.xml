	<body>Tape whose only positive points are Paul Giamatti (great as always, the rest as if they pass by there.) and the technical aspect, to rise to the occasion.The address fails miserably to such an extent that the history is borrosamente outlined on the screen; one does not know what they are trying to tell us until well into the hour and a quarter duration. And his screenplay, cheater until but not power, not helpful at all.Rather disappointing, although it can be seen and, at least, into what it should be, it is entretenidilla and "magical" sequences are quite attractive to the eye.</body>
