	<body>When at beginning of the years sixties appeared "Asterix the Gaul", first comic of this great saga, little could think the parents of the creature (René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo) the adventures of his characters would become a social phenomenon that transcend times, fashions, and ages. Probably not happened by the head these adventures, published in the fledgling magazine Pilote, would end up being carried the screens around the world in cartoons, real image and animation. But the reality is that almost thirty years after the death of the creator, opens the umpteenth adaptation (partial) of one of his comics (Asterix in Normandy). Asterix and the Vikings is another fun animated sitcom in which our protagonists are responsible for making a made man and right of the nephew of the Chief, Gudúrix, which is nothing more than an arrogant boy of low value. The thing is complicated when the mozalbete is kidnapped by the Vikings, it looks where sought an extremely fearful person that teach them to fly, that according to his Mage "fear gives wings". Asterix and Obelix are thrown towards the North in search of his protégé, who while there will be known to the charming Abba with her love. This installment has a greater number of action scenes and length of their nearly eighty minutes wasted good humour, dynamism and fluidity in the dialogues, which gives greater luster to this production franco-danesa. Great movie for children enjoy good drawings always, and cease to see for a while the esperpénticas series of children exhibitionist and rude coming from Japan, and that a national chain has bad taste program on a daily basis, for fear of parents and educators.</body>
