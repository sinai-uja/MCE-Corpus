	<summary>Monster House had been very well as one of the Amazing Stories of the 1980s Spielberg, but not a long of this century.</summary>
	<body>The main reason to see Monster House (2006), or the House of the scares, as it has been titled in Spanish, was the Steven Spielberg production credit. After all, the fabulous animated film Shrek occurred under the signature of DreamWorks, when the company was owned by Mr. Spielberg. And with that expectation ahead, Monster House is just regular.The story is about the House of an elderly neighbor grump who comes to life and wants to put an end to all forms of life in the neighborhood. And for all forms of life we refer to the three pre-teens protagonists, since apparently the animators they forgot that more than three people live in a neighborhood.The humanization of the House is great, that I will not cut credit. And I suppose it would have been much better to see (hear) with the original voice of Kathleen Turner, but I had to see it dubbed. The character of the macabre elder, Mr Nebbercracker, also highlights. But the creatures. Oh, the creatures (Yes, those of the poster, the protagonists, Heroes). They seemed poorly raised, enforced and unfriendly. Hardly, if one is not identified with the heroes can well enjoy the film.Monster House had been very well as one of the Amazing Stories of the 1980s Spielberg, but not a long of this century. Above all, coming after the very successful premieres of Cars and neighbors invaders, fences that you were very high.Another executive producer of Monster House is the sidekick of Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis, who has very good as Forrest Gump or the Na√∫frago movies and some very bad as Gothika or the House of wax. So both names in the credits, although extremely promising, can lead us also to the disappointment. Nothing is guaranteed in the 7th. art.</body>
