	<body>The best comedy in 2006. 'Borat' is a loop without end of absurd and totally hilarious situations created by a Sacha Baron Cohen in State of grace in your script in the form of a mockumentary, which makes total evidence to certain sectors and others of the American culture.Biting, incisive and politically very incorrect, 'Borat' laughs around the world with everyone and is extremely funny (although it must be acknowledged that it is not suitable for all tastes). It has one of the best male performances of the year (Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat Sagdiyev, maintaining the type during the hour and a half that lasts its creation, which unfortunately did not receive a deserved nomianci√≥n Oscar) and, possibly, one of the best and most hilarious comic sequences of the Decade (three words: two naked men).Almost kill me so that I could get to laugh.HIGHLY recommended (although as I have said before, unfortunately is not made to be digested by all).</body>
