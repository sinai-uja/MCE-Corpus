	<body>One of so many PSYCHO TRHILLERS of the eighties which stands out for its two actors actresses. JENNIFER JASON LEIGH all one star of the genre of the era after appearing in films of cult "Road to hell, SISTER SISTER heart midnight among others" and LAUREN TEWES enjoyed great popularity for his role in the successful series holiday at sea.In the direction a director who later achieved his biggest success by the comedy of undead fun night of ZOMBIES. The recent re-release on DVD just discover one of so many films hidden in his time, that although it has a very linear development, that script thousand times seen, if that can be given the good use of space. A single decoration of a block of apartments is well used to raise the intrigue, another point in its favour is the really unpleasant treatment of the rapist. A character taken to the extreme that hits you immediately falling into the antipathy that the viewer feels towards the, no doubt a merit of the author of the film that helps create the climate of tension.THE picture and music are excellent as well as all interpretations making of the film so many but really enjoyable.</body>
