	<body>Bryan De Palma after his "Femme Fatale"(que_quitando_a_Rebecca_Rojmin,_me_pareci√≥_un_poco_rollo) and "The Black Dahlia" (which seemed curious, although disappointing) points to the mockumentary genre to compose here a fairly constructive criticism to the prevailing patriotism and war these days takes place in the Middle, where again and it hurts the mouth tell citizens of Iraq are less "pobrecillos" of what he believes in USAon the other hand, and as in "Hearts of iron" embody, in a way more than television (and in full age of Youtube), one of the unfortunate events in year 2006 in full conflict belico, when some American soldiers, trying to avenge the death of one of its members of Squad, raped and murdered a girl, and were charged to the family of this without any kind of punches or suspicions.Since childhood I have heard listening to my father that "Nobody wins in the wars" and once again and in view of this movie I can not be more than agreement, since there is no neither winners nor losers, just shattered families, humiliated people, and most bodies in bags.Between the characters (perfectly embodied by a group of unknown actors) have all kinds of stereotypes, the Latin (which is here the camera of this documentary), stoked the war, and the sensitive, that all are are exchanging roles as progresses the action; on the other hand, De Palma affects too a kind of Puritanism in some moments, and brutality in others, leaving the lame and, like tape that made Robert Reford in "Lions for Lambs" not coming to be involved at all when it should, and at other times more than necessary implicandose.Between about revenge and attacks of others dedicated to avail themselves of a species of snake biting its tail, and that unfortunately, plasma, small (and great stay) is a war.Perhaps the best thing is (and I'll take a textual phrase) "better you have a reason that your friend die in your arms, not ensure fly in a million pieces".In short, another prism of the fearful and current war of Iraq.</body>
