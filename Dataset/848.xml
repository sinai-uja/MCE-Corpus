	<summary>Once we see a the film adaptation of the life, works and miracles of our Royal family?</summary>
	<body>On my recent visit to London, was one of the films was premiered this "The Queen", remember the uproar that caused the characterization of Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth, everytime someone lifted his head and saw the poster in London's "TheatreLand" district.The film, which tells the terrible events that occurred in London following the death of Diana of Wales, puts us in the sights, the British Royal family, both Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie; characterized as a curious and anti-royalist woman who pushes or causes a feeling of uneasiness in her husband.Interpretive level, Helen Mirren as borda, both in their gestures, postures, and gestures and makes us believe that we are to the real Queen, and not to an actress, also James Cromwell as the Duke of Edinburgh, is superb, perhaps, is distracted, curious and more concerned with 4 jets by the difficult situation that the Royal House was living at the timeI don't want to forget about the actor who gives life to the Prince Charles of England, Alex Jennings, dealt with their children suffer as little as possible and leaving aside his exacerbante passion for another woman, doing what a future King to do.Stephen Frears, composed a portrait pretty well shot, where images of the news and the real life of the Princess of Wales, along with the authentic scenarios where all development, aid to the full likelihood of the story.I imagine that many of her you viewing have thought will ever see a the film adaptation of the life, works and miracles of our Royal family? In short, an impressive recreation of an almost as famous as our family, not the real Royal family but the House.</body>
