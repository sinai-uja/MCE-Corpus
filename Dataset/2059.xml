	<summary>Sins of predictability and is that little that one is moderately attentive he realizes perfectly of the mystery that very on tiptoe, hides the tape, and is easy to know who is the endangered and the menacing.</summary>
	<body>Funny police thriller, written by one of the writers of one of my favorite series (the series of TV "Las vegas"), where we see to an Al Pacino, already entered in years (notice his heavy face when it is running), Alicia Witt, Deborah Kara Unger and Leelee Sobieski, the latter in a very fleeting role that one almost realizes little of their presence.Theoretically the action happens in real time (apasionar√≠a to fans of the series "24") but. the real time is not always coordinated perfectly and while at times 37 min. It appears that they fly in other 10 min. dan for almost half an hour of footage, on the other hand, rapid levels disservice do them to the vision of the same, and impossible to look clearly at some details.Note that Pacino came to cast almost rebound, as is little understood, but that the vast majority of female protagonists, the fall the baba with to, when they are only around twenty and Pacino already is all a Grandpa, by very sexy that might be to some (not deny it) females.The movie sins of predictability is that little to one this fairly attentive (no need be with the eyes as dishes) he realizes perfectly of the mystery that very on tiptoe, hides the tape, and is easy to know who is the endangered and the menacing.Finally, a co-production USA-Germany, that without having triumphed at the North American box office, will not make it in the Spanish (when it is release) and but time to time.</body>
