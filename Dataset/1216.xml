	<summary>Alarming improper this director's boredom is mixed with some childish critical intentions.</summary>
	<body>I record I told him more than one that this film gave me bad spine since that I saw the trailer. I tend to make mistakes, but in this case I not missed.Clint Eastwood returns to the fray with 2 movies on a same historical fact, in the manner of marketing of Quentin Tarantino and his Bodrio-Bill, but with a lot more attractive, obviously. And yet with this first film has had one of their biggest film stumbles. It seems not only invaded by a nostalgic sense of times past, but it is also a historical fact in a way nothing attractive when it could have exploited masterly as tends it to do.Alarming improper this director's boredom is mixed with some childish critical intentions linking directly to that "nana" used as the main theme of the soundtrack he composed.A story of soldiers idolized during the battle of Iwo Jima could have been an exemplary portrait of an uncomfortable but necessary situation for many people for different reasons. However in this film stays with 3 characters with whom little is empatiza and with a structure of such child as warmed-over flashbacks.The shadow of Spielberg is elongated, and in this film for two reasons. The first because an opportunity with big budget that rarely has had, and the second because after the Normandy landings in saving private Ryan, all sequences of war seems that they cut by this pattern has given Eastwood. And this is another case. But with better technology, clear. And other trifles that Spielberg did not include. But it seems that Clint passed chupi pumpkin shooting it it.In short, a very great disappointment of someone who directs masterpieces with extreme simplicity but great taste and talent. I hope the second part with more suspicion than to this first.</body>
