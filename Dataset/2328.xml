	<body>I hate the "road movies". Since that my film buff sense got reason (or at least the minimum that is) that I could not with them. Most will make me very, very cansinas. Do perhaps is why which?Transamerica? I have not filled what I expected, but that I liked enough to give the go-ahead. He is another road movie, but with an argument quite peculiar and interesting, and free of clichés.The most splendid Felicity Huffman (did Lynette Scavo in?)(Women desperate?) It makes a papelón portraying a transsexual woman, while waiting to arrive finally the long-awaited day in which will be subject to a genital reconstruction surgery, discovers that he has an illegitimate son of 18 years, and embarks on a journey with him to know him better.The main attraction of this film are undoubtedly its actors. The vast majority meet far. But that more shines with their own light is, as I have said before, Felicity Huffman. Actrizaza where they exist, never disappoints. Without any hesitation, I affirm and reaffirm that it is the jewel in the Crown and the main attraction of the tape of?Transamerica?. No doubt was a great injustice not won the Oscar for best performance 2005, being "overtaken" by Reese Whiterspoon, female protagonist who won the statuette for her role in?In tightrope?.?Transamerica? It is a quite suggestive, nice movie and something sweet and sour, which sets out the two sides of the coin of what supposed to be transsexual in United States in authority. He is also a notable exhibition that you can do good cinema with only four hard in the Pocket. Recommended and absolutely must see it in original version.</body>
