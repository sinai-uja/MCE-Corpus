	<summary>Argument helpings, simple and predictable, aesthetic videoclipera to but not power, the deafening music, disservice do them to the tape.</summary>
	<body>I must admit that the first 2 movies I liked, what is more, the first, with the direction of the video-clipero Rob Cohen, was an original proposal, ideal for fools of tunning and sports vehicles, the second, with a loose direction of John Singleton (food film where they exist), is simplistic, but again Paul Walter and Eva Mendes manage to save herApart from Cole Hauser, in both me I grabbed something I like, but in this? Let us be serious, complicated in this kind of films, a tape where the 10 min. Projection you are wishing to end, or that the players drop a ray. is not a good sign right? This happens with both actors, on the one hand we have to Bow Wow (or as noses call), a boy who I met at "Like Mike" and that should be as cheap as the Lady of the cleaning of the casting, since lately it appears in quite a few films, on the other hand the Lucas Black stranger and is that her roles in "Cold Mountain," "Jarhead" and "Friday Nights Lights" are not for more.The aesthetic videoclipera to but not power, the deafening music (I got out and got the volume of the DVD at least occasionally 500), argument helpings, simple and predictable but not power, girls wearing "chicha" (well that her said on the positive side, jodamos not), levels fast, almost made by manco brother of Michael Bay, disservice do you to the tape.And to think that at least kept a small hope that I liked.</body>
