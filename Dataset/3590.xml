	<summary>Interesting film of Paul Auster, poorly received by critics in the past Donostia 2007 International Film Festival.</summary>
	<body>"Martin Frost, a successful writer, has just published a book when he decides to retire to a country house for a time." Waking up the first morning, Frost discovers a mysterious and dazzling woman lying beside him surprised.Fascinated with her beauty and intelligence, Martin love deeply for her and thinks that he has met his muse will help to write his best novel. who is this mysterious woman who so well know his life and his work? It will be a real Muse? Is it your imagination? "Is she a ghost that has crept into the private life of Martin Frost?"Excellent idea of Paul Auster, fails all its perfect translation to the screen.

Thanks to this unique character we laugh at their fancy literary ideas, but we also saw a fall of rhythm and dramatic intensity, magnified with the appearance of the fourth character, played by the daughter of Auster, Sophie. A beautiful girl with a beautiful voice, but that frankly adds nothing to the story, giving the impression of being a beautiful decorative object for comfort of his father. Thus, by the way, it gives know. However, I think it is an estimable film, although certainly it is more a less. But the general final computer think it is positive.
