	<summary>I was not disappointed at all, but it left me with the question of what else would have brought me this film if I had not read the book.</summary>
	<body>I came to this movie with two completely personal problems. First, I have just read me the book and second, that the movie was filmed in the city where I was born (Barcelona) and where I live (Girona). I moved the movie compared to the book and looking for locations, respectively, and thus there is no who enters fully into the movie.Saving these problems, that the movie does not have any blame, the film is very good. As adaptation is sufficiently faithful to the book, and the few changes, I think that they are good choices. Shortens the part where Jean-Baptiste Grenouille, the protagonist, he spends years of solitude in a cave in a mountain, it is accentuated his murderous nature and aspects strictly film, as the performances, music, photography and the atmosphere, are excellent. Perhaps failure in abuse of the Narrator, who is too present, and explains things for those who have read the book are obvious and that perhaps they would be better only insinuadas.Total, that to be a long-awaited movie I was not disappointed at all, but I left with the question of what else would have brought me this film if I had not read the book and if it had been filmed in places that I knew not.</body>
