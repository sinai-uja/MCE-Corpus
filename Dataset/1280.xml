	<body>If they can avoid A good year (2006), avoid it. A romantic movie is absolutely flat and full of stereotypes, incredibly directed by the renowned Ridley Scott and starring the good actor Russell Crowe. In a nutshell, a scam.Crowe is Max Skinner, a cold and calculating agent of London Stock Exchange that suddenly sees her life disrupted by the sudden death of his uncle Henry, who has inherited a vineyard in France. This property represents to Max, all the memories of a happy childhood. You decide to go for a day to fix the papers and leave the House ready for the purchase, but things in life, it ends up staying more than one day, involving himself with simple things around and fell in love with the French more beautiful, the people and the simple life in the countryside. Colorín colorado. It's simple gentlemen.Scott and Crowe had worked together previously, with much better results: the Gladiator (2000). Those times.</body>
