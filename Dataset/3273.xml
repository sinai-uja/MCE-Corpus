	<summary>A hodgepodge that seems rather a remake of the first part the continuation of a story already in itself was a bit boring.</summary>
	<body>I admit that I like to see from time to time some of those movies that no one expects to be masterpieces, but that he presumed some ability to entertain, using large predators and other many arguments based on the fantasy combined with the action.Although, as I have already said, one is aware that it will not enjoy a classic, the truth is that they at least houses the expectation to have a good time, facing a script more or less coherent, contemplate a few credible special effects and, why not say it, perhaps see some unknown and nice actress begins in the challenging world of the celluloid.Unfortunately, in JAWS 2, there is not the slightest trace of motion picture decency, therefore seems more a continuation, a remake of the first part. The characters are modelled from its predecessor, without the slightest novelty or modification. Something similar happens with the script, since the course of the tempos is repeated in a shameful way, without adding anything new.Also worthy of mention that strange mixture between action-horror with a touch of comedy zafia and insubstantial much like on the other side of the Atlantic, but which find me abhorrent and grotesque.Nothing taste nor nothing to enjoy, as he finished this chestnut, I walked bad-tempered to the bar from the beach below House, living, unfortunately for his faithful, his last days of the season.</body>
