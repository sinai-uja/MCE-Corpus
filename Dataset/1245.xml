	<body>I had more than one incentive to see this movie: Pilar López de Ayala was the first of them. And it was inescapable, it would be anyway. Then it was the good Office of David Trueba as a screenwriter and a cast that promised. So why not see her? I think they are more than sufficient reasons and for many, quite powerful.Making the sentence of the director case "lately we are approaching the film with too much data, with the film seen in advance, and we need to eliminate the value of names, approaching the films with the senses and not with the trajectory of the people, and judging the film as the opening credits more", what I will write about the movie will be this: the film is a comedy urban, labor, and philosophical. It is a generational portrait, a story about the transition to the adult world: responsibilities, friendships, life partner, etc? and see how life in those moments. Humor is a very present, in addition to being the most successful and the most grateful. Filosófico-poético part - pessimistic is the weaker a movie part, but not the quality or the good time that makes you spend it lowers. One highly recommended film.Welcome home is a great title very well used in this film, but much better applied to real life, where many welcome to good movies like this.</body>
