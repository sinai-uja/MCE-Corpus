	<summary>Not reached all its objectives, but improves the first work of its author and thought-provoking. Interesting, but irregular tape of social denunciation with the excuse of a / a psicho-killer.</summary>
	<body>Irregular second film of its director, who to denounce the power of the press, journalists, and more specifically of the TV, always manipulative, is based on a real event that happened years earlier.And do it with a tremendous, very hard, start the attempt of the lynching. Then subdues everything and start the tricks of the two protagonists, tricks always based on lies and manipulation. All this will reach to fellow reporter, honest people who want to know the truth. But the other, even if you want the same, also wished success, reach the final. And peligrará the truth, he peligrará with his action the tranquility and peace of the good people of the place and others distant.It is well reflected in the film, although perhaps moments in that, without that decay interest, yes low intensity. And it is that with a very powerful start, it is normal that you download then. Something dangerous and that not always goes well.Esforzadas interpretations, with a John Leguizamo speaking quite well the Spanish, a Spanish who had to learn it fairly quickly because from the age of three lives in Los United States and their natural language is English.Damián Alcázar lives her role with the solvency that characterizes him and our Leonor Watling is as natural as it is usual.An interesting film that does not reach all their goals, but improves the first work of its author and thought-provoking.</body>
