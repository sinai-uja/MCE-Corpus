	<summary>Great movie, good work of Pedro Almodovar. I would especially highlight with Pé, (extremely attractive in this film), the role of Carmen Maura and is that from beginning to end, he manages to get the meat of chicken, also Blanca Portillo.</summary>
	<body>I must admit that Almodovar is not of my devotion and that except for "Talk to her" most of the films of the manchego director seem "supinos conaza" (almost always) cut in the same pattern, and where the intensity and narrative rhythm just being always the same dramatic elevations which by H or (b) appeal to the same in each of the samples of his cinematography; However, and as has already happened with the penultimate film of Peeeedroooo, (as said Pé, which in this film becomes her actress fetíche), has bedeviled me from beginning to end, and is that many are the years of my childhood which I spent in summer at home of my grandmother (in a village in Toledo) and where customsmodus operandi, and strange female behaviors, so well know translate Almodovar in this, his latest film.It could start to desvaratar in one thousand and one stories, things that happen in some scenes of the film and which remind me of "my people", but no, I will not do, I note only those "machine gun kisses" which gives the character of Blanca Portillo to all that is close and I well remember my aunts and my grandmother.I would especially highlight with Pé, (extremely attractive in this film), the role of Carmen Maura is that from beginning to end, it manages to get the meat of chicken, also Blanca Portillo, perhaps the more "catheter" of women onscreen, and is that "you think" perfectly his role, Lola Dueñas (which already sensed a bright future in "Mar Adentro" of Amenabar) also do wellThis aunt clueless and curious that there are in all family, Johana Cobo quite normalita, the truth, perhaps in a few years and based on roles to be the creature matures cinematically.In end, great movie, good work of Pedro Almodovar and enormous envy gives me in viewing see return to Carmen as a mother, that would I that back mine suddenly home!</body>
