	<body>The work of movie buff can be really hard, I try to cover several clubs I must submit to my brain to you authentic jewels of STANLEY KUBRICK and ORSON WELLS to suddenly move to a premiere of extreme mediocrity as e.g. ALIEN VS PREDATOR 2 Requiem, a third changes that can harm the mental health of anyone.Then comes the film more FREAK live where the amateur, the most extreme GORE in experiments that tends to produce authentic attacks of ulcer.In this type of art which is predominantly scurfy, managers who did not know how to turn on the camera much less use it, music that has a single chord, the actors caught from the street and a few special effects designed with clay and a little paint, effectively the script is usually performed in a couple of hours by writers up to eyebrows of several suspicious substances.The such WAYNE BERWICK "the naked monster" rodeo a crusted cast of half fans who tried to earn a living participating in all living by-product to the TROUPE collaborated in classics of dandruff with FEAST and the beautiful ANNA MARLOWE walked light clothing in THE MUTILATOR or BEYOND EVIL.Once someone utter a memorable phrase that opened my eyes, "have to learn to enjoy bad films because they may be surpassing".No doubt this product is one of the greatest exponents of the phrase, an authentic desmadre PSICOTRONICO and COOL where a man kills his wife for not giving him good to eat, is it so absurd that it is really hilarious to the wave of laughter causing a few dialogues written in full collective insanity.So cheap it is everything that a small production of TROMA is a blockbuster in comparison.With friends, beers and leaving the brain at a dead you can enjoy as nice without trying to give the sense at least, one of these disastrous films but with a priceless freshness in every scene.</body>
