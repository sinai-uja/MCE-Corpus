	<summary>A relaxed comedy in which the stories and characters born from the imagination of its protagonist serve to create a completely new story around him.</summary>
	<body>The amorous adventures of the young Molière is the second feature-length French Lauren Tirard, and is portrayed by Roman Duris, Fabrice Luchini, Laura Morante, Edouard Baer, Mélanie Dos Santos, Gonzague Montuel and Gilian Petrov.La film focuses on the teenage years of Molière, with just twenty-two years, be vé unable to cope with debts confronting his humble theater company. As well and all, sick represent farces, Molière is still obcecado to write tragedies, so it will inevitably end in prison, to where it will be rescued by a wealthy bourgeois seeking their services to learn to interpret, and thus conquer the heart of a young woman of the nobility.Far from wanting to move to the cinema the theatrical work of the father of the comédie française, the amorous adventures of the young Molière is much closer, for example, Shakespeare in love, which of the adaptations of Kenneth Brannagh, to cite the reference more obvious. Thus, Lauren Tirard constructed from certain specific biographical events a story of love and what not, maturity both spiritual and professional, populating them with the characters (or, rather, characteristics of various characters) of the play by Molière.Thus, the Molière played by Roman Duris in part adopts the role of his falsely beato Tartuffe, and indeed its history resembles in some respects to the theatrical work itself; Similarly, the character of Laura Morante is baptized with the name of Celimena, which we can find in Le Misanthrope, although it shows features of diverse characters. And the same is true, without going further, with the wealthy Jourdain, basically the Orgone Tartuffe, although no longer the typical bourgeois represented in many of his farces.And it is that, if something is defined the work of Molière, is by their ability to portray and ridicule to the society of his time, creating characters seemingly archetypal but always unique, achieving, at the same time, so that we are something in us that, beyond the laughter, his works make us correct or at leastreflect on our own shortcomings.Going to the movie itself, I must say that the amorous adventures of the young Molière I loved, in spite of its apparent simplicity and frivolity. Lauren Tirard film seems like a fairly accurate translation of the work in the life of the then young author, in which the caricaturisation of the characters through the farce shows both a faithful reflection of the French society of the 17TH century as a personal evolution that leads to the artistic maturity.Stand out, even more than the couple own protagonist constituted by Roman Duris and Laura Morante, a simply great Fabrice Luchini in their role of short-sighted bourgeois, horned and dam of a febrile teenage infatuation with a hilarious Edouard Baer, archetype of a proud nobility coming unless you must forge alliances with the growing bourgeoisie.Thus, we could define the amorous adventures of the young Molière as a sort of Gallic version of the drama Shakespeare in love, in which stories and characters born from the imagination of its protagonist serve to create a completely new story surrounding him.I give it a 7 out of 10.</body>
