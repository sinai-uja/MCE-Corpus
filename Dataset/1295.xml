	<body>Nobody, absolutely nobody, gave a hard by this Rocky; No one believed that Stallone was able to return to the series than were their first deliveries, as nobody gave a hard because Rocky plantase face in his final match; but Stallone has done, has created a product to the height of what was at the time the saga. It is a grand finale to a saga which did not deserve to end at Rocky V.Es impossible not to enjoy with this movie those who pequeñazos we enjoying every bite of the Italian Colt. "Rocky Balboa" is a nostalgic view of the myth, perhaps occasionally too steeped in nostalgia, but are their defects also part of their virtues; We see a Rocky full of ghosts of the past, more sore by the blows of life than by the quadrilateral, which only remain memories of a most brilliant past and a handful of anecdotes to tell customers of his bar. It is a continuous return to the past, a tribute to Rocky and the own Stallone, a beautiful and sometimes tontorrona but very honest reflection on the old glories and the passage of time.Commendable work of Stallone with this film. It could have been confined to sell us a match of an old Rocky and problems with drugs, with the famosote of turn; but his love for the character were prevented from and had to give it a fitting end to the saga. Perhaps as more negative point of the tape is that the rival lacks charisma and no falls short, but gives equal, because the absolute protagonist of this film is Rocky. It is definitely exciting and loving tribute to a living myth.</body>
