	<body>After for me one more than brilliant first delivery and a loose, flojísima second, little desire to me were passing through box office for viewing this third part, it had to be my wife, perhaps motivated by the staff of beautiful faces (Clooney, Pitt, Damon) who almost dragged led me to see this third installment, which tries to combine equal parts and with little master, now already seen in the 2 previous installments, and is that no mistake "Ocean's 13" is nothing more than a rehash of apparently previously.Clooney, Pitt, Damon y CIA. they are as always, nor more nor less, Pacino (although only its presence is already reason to pay without protest the 6.5? input), is restrained (and badly bent), Andy Garcia linear and simpleton and perhaps the only breath of hope is Ellen Barkin and not by his interpretation, but by the well preserved (and sexy which is) with their 50 and many springs.In this third part of Danny Oceans gang returns to las vegas, perhaps and with the permission of NY one of the older (and more realistic) sets of cinema, in the middle of the street, and it is that there are so many series and films set in this small plot of the Nevada desert, that one cannot help but a touch of sweetness, and something like healthy envy to see these celluloid stars pass through places that server only can dream.Can not say that I loved (mentiria), or which will be a tape odie (also would be lacking to the truth), although if I had moments that moved by a copious meal and the fragile freshness that we now live in Madrid, I've been on the verge of bending the spine and let me fall into the arms of Morpheus; that each one understands what they want.</body>
