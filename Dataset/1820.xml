	<body>Interesting film of psychological intrigue, benefited by the extraordinary work of two immense actresses: Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett.Porque if it were not for them the film resentiría, to begin with, a lack of truly remarkable rigor. In addition to some guionísticas eccentricities and exits of tone that easily her could do little convincing, at least from the point of view of the more logical minimum (the reason for which expands the secret is of descojono, as well as the scene in which are about to go to the premiere of the work in which intervene the son of Blanchett).But thanks to the great work of these ladies of the interpretation, as well as the superb soundtrack by Philip Glass, with a potential huge dramatic in some scenes, such as when Blanchett comes with the newspaper to meet journalistic carrion, is achieved by the Viewer to follow the story forward expressing to do it, sometimes exciting.If it reflects a little at the end of the vision of the tape, one can realize that, ultimately, there has been too much noise and not too many nuts, but while you are viewing is undeniable that force printed at certain moments, freeze without remedy, by passing a good time.I do not think it a good movie, but as it happened years ago with "Fatal attraction", it has hypnotic power thanks to the clever mixture of different genres who know how to win over the respectable, although it is far from having much film quality.</body>
