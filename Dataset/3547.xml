	<body>hen the animated characters escaping from their worlds of fiction and landing in London the thing was much more entertaining. Mary Poppins or the witch freshman managed to sing or speak with animals of two dimensions not only make normal if that were not very well regarded. But Giselle, &hellip; Oh! That's another story. After meditating on this film so terribly boring and silly I decided to entertain me with the fantasy of the enchanted Prince (not teatrero James Marsden that is fashionable after Hairspray) if not with Patrick Dempsey what encourages tremendous Mr to get into the last production of the Disney? I hope that for the pleasure of sharing poster with the Sarandon (another that seems lost in this nonsense) or so that their children who have just come to the world (twins have played the poor) can soon see the movies of their Pope with pride but I just do not see the justification full-scale firecracker. Of the rest of the cast &hellip; Amy Adams do not have any grace; Idina Mendez who sings as God (protagonist of Broadway musical and West End Wicked or Rent) has neither a scene of singing; Timothy Spall, who has been with Wormtail face until it dies of old &hellip; nonsense!No grace and no interest this cocktail disneliano for the holidays.
