	<body>Nice movie that unites different genres, being of pure comedy which won the role. Because everything that happens in the tape is subordinated to the prism of humor under which everything is narrated. There are elements of thriller, Detective film, even phsycho killer, but all told with much humor, sometimes humorous, sometimes with undoubted fine styling apuntos, but always making laugh to the viewer which, however, must enter into the great joke that is being, and all, this work of the for me ignoto Finn Taylor also has said that everything is subordinated to the genre of the romantic comedy, and it is true because, at the end and all, the search for true love, true love, what is permanently in game.The development of the film is uneven, with episodes truly achieved, as the of the sadly defunct Chris Penn, other authentic descojono, Julianna Magulies, and others a bit stupid, but always the smile is achieved an accomplice of the Viewer. No, is not at all a good movie, but it is effective in its humor, quite funny, and that is made without other moods that do have a good time at the spectator. And I think that, above all to the delivered work of its effective performers, is achieved.</body>
