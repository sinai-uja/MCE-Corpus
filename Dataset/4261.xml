	<body>Double debut of the unknown director John KALANGIS, say double because he made his debut in the horror film but with much comedy and in addition is the first job that comes to our country. As actor however already saw in my big Greek wedding at his side in the direction still unpublished comedies JACK I JILL and LOVE IS WORK.Both featured her actress SHAUNA MCDONALD to fetish in is occasion adds a BILLI ZANE at their lowest moment although his career by removing isolated from TITANIC success was never too relevant.Starts well is series (b) typical of ZOMBIES, with lucky GAGS, good GORE effects, mix really hilarious moments.However is only a mirage because development too abused humor unfinished decide towards the horror pure or the humorous leaving half in both directions. Makeup may catalog of catastrophic removing credibility to the man-eaters of meat. Once more a good initial idea stays on very little thing in the absence of imagination to continue along the same path.A shame.</body>
