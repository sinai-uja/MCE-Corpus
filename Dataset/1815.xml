	<summary>The film won't be to the annals of the 7th Art, but must see that well so I happened to me seeing it.</summary>
	<body>Tape divertidamente geek, which was a promotion in brutal internet and finally stayed in a bluff, is a shame, since long ago that I it not amused both watching a tape of these features, that captures both the action cinema of the 1980s, even in the image and the look of the hero of the moment, excellently translated by Samuel L.Jacksonthe current approach to characters such as Chuck Norris or Charles Bronson.Previsible to but not power, is that you one since the beginning and after a brief presentation of characters, stereotypical but not power, we soon get into flour, the 20 min. projection, already you are grappling with the Pataki Serpientes.Elsa in her first role in the USA, makes Spanish mother (seems 100% Andalusian). Similar to "Missing flight Plan" set is an entire aircraft, with its two floors (only so worth seeing the film), by Curran which are the sets of the film.The villain of the function, an apprentice of Bruce Lee, inspires little confidence, but is a copy of all the villains in the films of yesteryear. Found me quite original vision in green snakes, although others many, CGI-based singing too (others also noticed that they were plastic).Come on, the film won't be to the annals of the 7th Art, but do look that well me I had seeing it.</body>
