	<body>"A Hunter moved to Germany with the intention to hunt some deer, for example." A day is at the top of a hill the figure of Adolf Hitler, he points with his telescopic but not shoot because it is not a murderer. However at that moment is captured and tortured by the Gestapo. "He escapes and returns to London, where will continue to persecuted."Interesting film of Fritz Lang, the first of his films that played the thematic antinazi openly. It has undoubted narrative force and its climax is surround, thanks mainly to the impressive photography in black and white, very suggestive, and ominous shadows. The staging is superb. However, and perhaps therefore as bleak, is a both opresora insofar as that might be to some ugliness Viewer. But the tape like to be admirably narrated and a pace expressing that reaches passionate at times. Well Joan Bennett, excellent as always.</body>
