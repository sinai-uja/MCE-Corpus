	<body>The steps of the horror film, is really strange where tapes of low-value type SAW end up becoming classics of immediately, while small jewels are cruelly neglected since their premieres.Nearly a decade of time a then unknown JUDE LAW "of highly topical at the moment with the imprint" gave us a fascinating character under the tutelage of the Asian PO CHIH LEONG interesting TV movies horror author "The House of the Lake and continuation". Between the side we were with good performers that they gave perfectly her replica to the young actor. TIMOTHY SPALL a mortadella of great efficacy seen in the last samurai or ROCK STAR among many others and JACK DAVENPORT participated in the millionaire saga of Pirates of the Caribbean.The film is an entire universe where the intrigue plays a critical role not knowing is at no time is the main character. From the start we know that it kills women but the question is why?The film is one proposal to philosophical unanswered where what matters is not the usual carried the Viewer on a journey without return between love or survival. All this adorned by a music and photography that immerses us in the strange world where the characters move.A final which explains half the terrible situation of the converted predator in victim going through a really terrifying time mixed by a passionate love story.</body>
