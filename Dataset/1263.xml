	<body>That bad I have in view, that thought was Will Smith of the poster, and is a type that no know. Well, at least this error led me to meet my quota of monthly dramas without much tear and nasal moqueo.The film is about Patrick Chamusso, a black man living in South Africa during apartheid. He works at a refinery and has managed to become foreman, as well as having a wife that she wants to and two precious daughters. Even dedicated his free time to train some kids to soccer. This hobby, together with another that is not the case, led him to be suspected of terrorism by which it is treated as such. So great was that rolled it became an icon of the liberation of South Africa, I say no more.Good, good, a dramita to start the week. I have to say that, despite being a drama, I liked the movie. It has excessively harsh scenes and does not leave a feeling too bad. Isn't that the thing is loose if that isn't treated with less harshness than it could be. To highlight the work of Tim Robins, which comes the role of bad things like ring to the finger. And, as always, I love that this is a real case and that at the end leave the Lord (you know that does not die) real alongside actor. We could say that it is a hymn to freedom.In short, drama on apartheid based on the life of a real person. It is not mourn or severely hurt the soul, if not a biography that shows us how human beings can transform.</body>
