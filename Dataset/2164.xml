	<summary>Film that is completed? Pirates of the Caribbean saga. It is quite long, although the final result is good. We have less more action and more Sparrow, and there are plenty love, honors and demases.</summary>
	<body>Notice to the impatient that rise the two seconds to finish the film, there is one scene at the end of the closing credits. Such as when shark it protruded a fin of the sea. Of which tell you that maybe we have quarter. By the way, take this opportunity to tell those who stood before, to be, but that does not remain standing, if you have behind you are interested in credits, right?The film is about a group of pirates who are being harassed by the English Navy and by the Dutch Errante, a Ghost ship whose crew is men with aspect of marine animals. To get rid of so heavy burden, the pirates are at the end of the world, to rescue Jack Sparrow, then devise a plan that gives them the freedom to hack to taste again.Well, the third installment of the pirates I was not disappointed, but I has become extremely long. But inhumanly long. It has good moments of struggles, shots, espadazos and good sense of humor, but very long. Too much. The plot is not bad, but too lost in something secondary stories, depriving us of what really we want, are fighting and action. It is that even in the action scenes we pe√±azo pieces of charloteo on the divine and the mundane.In short, film that is completed? Pirates of the Caribbean saga. It is quite long, although the final result is good. We have less more action and more Sparrow, and there are plenty love, honors and demases.You might better, of course.kisses.</body>
