	<body>Very curious is that in the USA they of sports and!He hala time-tested film on the subject! Well, is that in the magazine TIME devoted you a cover to the "Dodgball" which is nothing more and nothing less than that game so stupid that all have played once when we were small in the courtyard of the school and of course, producers eager for films, in this 2004 who walks a little short film, decided to make a film on the subject.Ben Stiller think that he makes films like hotcakes and I wonder will this man out of the sets have their own life? her Vince Vaughn has starred along with his colleague from fatigue (that bad I like this guy from the remake of "Psycho") resulting in the typical movie to see with friends with a few cans of beer and pizzas and debt of the cinema of the Farrelly brothers (scatological humor and cochinote) to 120% what the tape is to entertain, the trouble is that most of the fun points over and over again shown them in trailers (asi) (if you have already seen these you have seen the best of the film).</body>
