	<summary>A funny comedy, starring Kurt Russell and Goldie Hank with very very funny moments.</summary>
	<body>In 1987 Garry Marshall, author of the mythical and famous "Pretty Woman" made this film, vehicle for showcasing of the 2 protagonists (who were already a couple), Kurt Russell and Goldie Hanw (why this woman I remember every day to her daughter Kate Hudson?) and became one of those mythical tapes with some moments that will remain in the retina of the Viewer for a long timeIt is true that we have a romantic comedy to the use, but the 3rd grade to which the character of Russell subjected the Hawn as revenge for how bad she has dealt worth from beginning to end? Well, the end I leave for females that like both these final elducorados.Incidentally, tape WINS integers in V.O. Since many of the Concierto made are worth its price in gold in original version, it is true that we need a little bit more than cinematographic culture and geek to be able to pick up, that is why in his voice have gone to easy, not giving many laps in his "alleged translation".In addition to the protagonists are a fun staff of side, many of them common in the Filmography of Marshall, Edward Herrmann, Katherine Helmond, Michael Hagerty, names a priori not sound but if its rostos all comedies that we have seen a thousand times.Finally, and not for less important, the soundtrack filled with Southern music based on bangio, the most fun one you can put as sound to a movie of this kind.</body>
