	<body>"A young man you want to be a writer of novels of the West, in the manner of Zane Grey, moved to the West to see in situ the Cowboys, Indians, if any, etc., to soak the idiosyncrasies of these good and honest people to admire both."However, his arrival begins with an attempted robbery by two malefactors. In their flight, grab them, without wanting to, money, so it will be followed by them."Meanwhile, meet people of rolling western cinema, starting a new life of extra".Well-intentioned but mediocre film, where it is looking back with a laudable attempt to homage to a now extinct world of incipient talkie filmed outdoors and under conditions, sometimes precarious.Through humor are seeing parade characters, some endearing, others somewhat jets that they disappear from the movie without leaving traces, and customs that might be curious.But all this under a television planning, with a direction rather flat, with a hyphen not too lucky, perhaps emotional, but no spark.Yes there are some good things, as the interpretation of Bridges, Blythe Danner, Gwylneth Paltrow mother (Incidentally, Danner in this film is the living portrait of his daughter as it stands now the latter), and wing Arkin as the director Grump that treats get even blood to their extras.No, has nothing really remarkable this movie, although at certain times contains a sympathetic humor rather naive, as the moment in which the good bridges presents volunteer for a dangerous scene: throw from atop a saloom to the saddle of his horse. Needless to say what happens to fall from great height to the saddle. "Omelet" in effect.</body>
