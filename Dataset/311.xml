And he watched as the House was eaten to the protagonist. And I said, "this when it comes out, have to do it". But as I have fallen a press by handsome pass, because have seen before the rest of mortals, it, je.The film is a preteen kid called Walters DJ who is obsessed with the neighbor of the House opposite, an old man with bad milk called Nebbercracker.

I liked the script, given that isn't 침o침o or absurd, and has very little moralina. It is a quick action, a short movie and great quality.

For this reason I think that it is more for a teen audience onwards.In short, a pelicul칩n of animation with a good script, very well developed.</body>
