	<summary>Two parallel stories intersect with great dynamism in this good film that works perfectly with what is expected of him, surprising for his brutality in an era where raw correction.</summary>
	<body>We are clear that the lack of ideas in the horror and cinema in general are trying to cover with REMAKES to hundreds of old cult films. At is time touches the revision of a notable SLASHER led in the mid-1970s by the director of "PORKIS" "BOB CLARK" in early career showed a great talent for terror both with this film or the same year DEATHDREAM. Then would come unfortunately for fans to the genre into a spiral of increasingly less interesting comedies.As for example "KARATE DOG or small great HEROES" this review of one of their first films seems one of these REMAKES entering by the front door as we enjoy with "LA massacre DE TEZAS or the dawn of the dead" in recent years. Rookie GLEN MORGAN is not engaged in copying and puts a sick air at all times, with a few murders full of nasty recovering Al GORE and the oppressive atmosphere of the golden age of the genre.Two parallel stories intersect with great dynamism in this good film that works perfectly with what is expected of him, surprising for his brutality in an era where raw correction.</body>
