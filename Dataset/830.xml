	<summary>Tremendous show of good cinema, are interested in, leaves good taste, and ends leaving surprised spectators, more than anything by the tremendous magic tricks of the character who plays Edward Norton.</summary>
	<body>A priori one of the releases I wanted more see this week, while the excellent critique of Tito Chinchan has pushed me even more, if you can.After seeing "The Prestige", was still wanting more to see it, the problem, is that both tapes are, like the night and the day, and is quite easy to fall into the comparisons, until even their surprising end, it happens in both, and is that, when you reveal a magic trick, this is surprising, and begins to be obvious in the case of the illusionist, both Norton and Giamatti (more the second than the first), interpret the roles actors, while one is identified and most fond with the protagonist of "The youth of the water", than with the of "the fight club", and although we are all aware of the great potential of this, Giamatti, whom we deserve to pay tribute, that, undoubtedly, its interpretative work leaves the viewer in the best of dreams. Both Jessica Biel (mere comparsa and vase women, as Johansson in "The prestige") as Rufus Sewell (a bad so very bad rather than hatred, laugh), there are two of these roles to forget, and while the Biel shares poster and face, with the protagonists in the poster, of Sewell who will always remember "Fate of Knight", fails the soles of the shoes from the rest of casting.Not wanted to forget me Eddie Marsan, a name which probably not you sound, and his excellent performances, have left their mark in "the secret of Vera Drake", "Miami Vice" or here, as an Assistant to Norton, an actor to recommend and that I hope will become those usual side typical.Covered in a short Prize story Pulitzer Steven Millhauser, this film, which at times seems to stop dry, is a tremendous show of good cinema, are interested in leaves good taste and ends leaving surprised spectators, more than anything by the tremendous magic tricks of the character who plays Edward Norton, although the argument lack a bit of salt, and him on a tad of sugar.</body>
