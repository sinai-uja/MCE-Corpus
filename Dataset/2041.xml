	<summary>Audrey Tatou returns to the romantic comedy, but this time not convinced. He will not like Audrey Tatou fans or lovers of romantic comedy...</summary>
	<body>Audrey Tatou, the intimate Amelie, abandons his disguise of dúlce and tender to embody a "devours men", a beautiful and cosmopolitan woman who uses men to give him money and a life of luxury. Everything is apparently well with her wealthy partner until that a shy hotel worker falls madly in love of it. As she leaves only with people of "high standing", this poses as billionaire. And as the truth is always way out in the light, when we discover the cake already we have the typical romantic comedy.Only that in this case the film does not work. The two protagonists characters lack the necessary charm that you believe their characters (and it is truly painful to see Amelie trying to be what is not, a she-Wolf with lots of curves). In fact there are until a nod to the film Jeunet, as Salvadori comes up go to the two protagonists to a motorcycle (does someone sound?).The realization of Salvatori is conventional and deconstructed and as I have already said the performances of the actors fail to help to fill the plot or rhythmic gap of this film.He will not like Audrey Tatou fans or lovers of romantic comedy. I forecast that it will last little in Billboard, when it release in June 2007.</body>
