	<body>This summer comes strong with regard to blockbuster films, those of popcorn and flat encefalogramas. Not usual that we find so much supply, that really makes you doubt on what to see. And above all it is not usual that a movie with an adolescent protagonist, focused on a broad spectrum of viewers, is entertaining and fun like this.The film is about a teenager of 14 years (some more I would say) that has a guy that the considered boring. It is soon discovered that it is dull guy is a secret agent of MI6, and upon his death, the young Alex has to deal with a mission. Apparently, secretly his uncle had taught him various disciplines of spy. Specifically, the task is to know what is hidden behind the new personal supercomputer that will come out to the market.Amazing movie, by Jove. You know that when you do not expect anything, because you look at always favorably. We can say that we we have a new James Bond with acne and hormones to fertilize a haren. Lots of vibrant action, fun inventions and characters that hooked. The characterization of the characters deserve a special mention, since you see that they are clearly focused on a teenager, but rather demanding audience. The bad guys are diabolical and evil, but very tontorrones objectives (as well as superfeos). The good are prototypical, with a head of MI6 which gives much laughter.In short, action film teenage that appeal to older. It can be seen perfectly, to mix large doses of action with interesting dialogues within very short time. Highly recommended to pour the cool afternoon in this incipient summer.</body>
