	<body>My super ex-girlfriend has less interest as film of the genre of superheroes, which does not provide much as sitcom, which added to the desmelene of the superpowers. Uma Thurman's character is a superhero that fly and save the world from time to time, but is also a neurotic woman who becomes possessive when it falls.The film dares with this taboo subject which is the sexual lives of superheroes. The comedy works when creators imagine the Supergirl in bed or, worse still, jealous, and works much better when he mix everyday situations with the excesses of fantasy films, such as the occurrence of the car. Drama, which looks only in a couple of scenes, almost reaches incisor when he explores it is what makes us dreaming be magnetic and answers that it is this appalling powerlessness we feel when not we want it to.</body>
