	<body>After his appearance (as a director), the penultimate installment of the adventures of Harry Potter, Alfonso Cuar√≥n, directs this film's futuristic setting, which makes it revuelvan our consciences, starring Clive Owen (from "Closer" me has started to Marvel), Julianne Moore (in his usual, always upward line) and Michael Caine in the role of Grandpa "fingered".Filmed in London, in places that I know well by having been there for honeymoon, and giving the photo a dirty touch, almost 3rd mundista, the film gets one out of the film pensive, thinking that perhaps, like Julio Verne in his books, Cuaron tells us other than as fable as truth, no doubtmany of the things we see on the screen do not leave anyone indifferent, immigration, fear of rejection, political conspiracy.Finally, one of those movies that seem to go on tiptoe and that, however, and I turn to what my father said, "let poso" inside.</body>
