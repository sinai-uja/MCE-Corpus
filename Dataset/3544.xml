	<body>September 26, 1984 died Paquirri, I remember perfectly as I with 8 years looked in TV perplexed as the right-handed indicated the doctor as his injury, fatal necessity, and as the housemate of yesteryear (23 years ago) let me really impressed, we are talking about a few years where the TV was not what is now, and that easily impressionable, server and that you tide if you see a drop of blood, for many years, was completely impressed with those images; I know well that REC and Paquirri have no bearing, but if TV reality in which the tape of Plaza and Balagueró we put, a sort of "pasaje del terror" film, that it is true that it is less than what it seems and over which suggests, I admit, that was prepared for something much worse, and that, minutes before entering the cinema still feared dying of fear in the stalls, moreover, even went to the bathroom before, if one of the horrors he had to download my sphincter (haha).The documentary format and camera in hand, makes functions to 50%, because there are times that it brings reality to the plot, and others that tide (above I without glasses.), a fresh and interesting way of making new films, but that hopefully not burn too much, because that one or two films of this type per year, as experiment would be quite well (outside circles of festivals and other paraphernalia)However, if now enter all horror movies so. Bad thing.Is also true, that impresses the tape (not deny otherwise), but once one him picks up the "tranquillo", comprising roughly the plot is less terrifying than one imagines or supposed before entering the room; separate mention of actors and a couple of comical situations Balagueró and Plaza get to relax a little in the frightened audience.Something I've read in quite a few reviews and so I quite agree is that it is abusing both perhaps screams volume up too much of the lead actress (excellent Manuela Velasco, Sitges best actress award), and their scared close-up, losing in some moments the "approach" of the reality we want to show the tape.In short, Terrifying, shocking, fearful and cruel, but, rather than a film, a cinematic experience, must be set aside which is a Ribbon, and see it more as a kind of fair attraction, if we analyze as tape, this would lose many but that many points.</body>
