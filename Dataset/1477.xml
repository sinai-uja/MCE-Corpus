	<body>I do not know very well the reason why I became interested in the movie, perhaps because the poster I love, and to see her with both Prize and so much hype I said, unsure that I like, referred once I only think I liked to 50% and is expected more than the 2nd movie of Todd Field, a drama with several intermingled stories "Lives Crusades" style of Robert Altman (RIP)a reference in this kind of gimmicky stories.To begin its excessive length, for my taste elongated nauseam with that indecent Narrator, more reminiscent of a story than to an adult film, and where it shows in parathyroids the transition from novel to film, sometimes it is better to guess than tell us loud.I break a lance in favor of Jennifer Connelly and Kate Winslet, the latter perhaps the best of the film, the Connelly is mention, and it is that only appear, though it appears little, I drop the baba with her.With enough care dialogue (although sometimes are a tad foolish), and with a predictable argument, so entreabierta plot deserved a more notable end, shows what so know that we all have secrets", pity that at times, which is silent otorga, leading to his actors to situations it limit which does not always know out with ease.In short: a good exercise of film, very badly resolved.</body>
