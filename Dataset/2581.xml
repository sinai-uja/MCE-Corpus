	<summary>After years of waiting, Hommer devotees are in luck by being able to enjoy it in size XXL. The film is almost unimportant.</summary>
	<body>Few could imagine something more than 20 years ago, when they began to appear the Simpsons Tracey Ullman programme, that two decades later, these guys would form part of the daily life of half the world, and that there are almost 500 episodes, thousands of objects with their faces and phrases, clubs of followers fans and even a feature film.Matt Groening series has become the benchmark of animation for adults, and its shadow have grown up other projects that have tried to follow his footsteps, without ever reaching the height reached by the series of the Fox in wit, nor in originality or charisma. Now, when it recently announced the issuance of the season 19, Simpsons the movie premieres. Bring cinema to Hommer and theirs, it was in the mind of Fox for years, but opposition to the project from Groening slowed its development. There is no denying that the film has all the ingredients that have become runaway success to the saga, and that its interest is accentuated by the fact of being able to enjoy the adventures of the yellow family on the big screen. On the contrary, it may come too late, when the imagination of writers starts to show signs of exhaustion and plot quality of recent seasons has begun to wane. The film is not bad, and as a curiosity it is interesting, because it retains the transgressive and critical tone that have become immortal. Perhaps shows the Fox more fearful of the response of the general public that usual and therefore focuses on estates generally indiscriminate sarcastic exits as the Church that today seems more vulnerable to attacks. Nevertheless, welcome Simpson.</body>
