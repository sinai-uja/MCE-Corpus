	<body>First thing, this movie is bad, bad, bad. A group of American kids attend the night of Halloween to the forest, with beers and leftover hormones. Meanwhile, a grajero in the,(casualmente_esa_tarde_noche,_mira_tu_por_donde) area, is a tomb with a menacing inscription (covered by dried leaves and a bit of Earth), and after opening it, (which everyone would do in his situation) a zombie hits a Museum in the neck. From here ended the argument, because the film turns into a massacre without sense, dode all die, and where the viewer knows that everyone will die.Unnecessarily long scenes, crude and free erotic, crappy makeup, unfortunate interpretations, and an infernal dub make one is raised to stop the movie constantly. Just to save a couple of details: the family murder perpetrated by son, daughter and zombie wife of family guy. And an enigmatic phrase: "They are dead and are dangerous" so is this humbug of movie, 1988, directed and written by Bill Hinzman. Considered a classic by many. Basically it is a shit movie. But well, I me her swallowed. will I be copr√≥fago?</body>
