	<body>"A famous doctor and paleontologist is sure to discover the traces of the Yeti, the famous man in the snow." You want to get in touch with him, to try a positive relationship for both parties. "However he faced the expedition with several men who have the same goals in the company".Little known film of fantasy genre (in case of there is no really "The Yeti"), admitting that it is pure B series, involving some positive findings. The most important is the treatment given to the famous man of las nieves, which only comes at the end of the tape, being the moment, no doubt some most beautiful movie. The last few minutes are a great poetry. It is true however that the film suffers from a slightly premioso pace that lastra interest, being altogether somewhat slow. Excellent Peter Cushing and Forrest Tucker, a so-called "secondary" actor that always made him very well.</body>
