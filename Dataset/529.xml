	<body>Already more than ten years of the premiere of Clerks, the principle of an irregular career of Kevin Smith. Clerks was surprised by its freshness, for some brilliant dialogues and being shot with four hard. Now comes to our Clerks II screens a priori unnecessary sequel to Kevin Smith wants to return to its origins, after seeing her, not only does not seem unnecessary, if not beat the first and even makes it better. Clerks II begins in front of the Quick Stop where Dante and Randall have been working more than ten years, then see how Quick Stop has suffered a fire. This forces them to seek new employment horizons. Your new place of work found at Mooby's, a burger bar where meets a new bunch of freaks while Dante plans to leave New Jersey with his fianc√©e and rebuild their lives. And Mr Kevin Smith seems he returns with his best film, at the height of his best movie (Chasing Amy), because in Clerks II, maintains the best of Clerks and also adds a plot dramatic that it gives more depth and meaning everything around to Clerks. IE is still grandisimas dose of fun, unpayable gags on the Lord of the rings and the show with the donkey. Do but also the dramatic load gives a greater depth to the characters and what surrounds them, magnificent reflections, on the passage of time, the friendship and etc? Because Clerks II is a story about some misfit losers, but they conform to be what they are because that's enough them to be happy. A waste of love and sincerity by Kevin Smith for a few characters that is impossible not to want to. By true, impressive Rosario Dawson.</body>
