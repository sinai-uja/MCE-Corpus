	<body>Some people think that there are times in which seems the best you can do a director after making a masterpiece retire to avoid comparisons, or even ridicule. Without doubt, the hive and the Holy Innocents are two of the largest Spanish films of all time, and to Mario Camus it must represent a great responsibility trying to match them.El Prado of the stars, Cantabrian filmmaker returns to the film after five years, and does so with a very personal film shot in his own land. It's a very choral story, mixing the dreams and hopes of youth, love, loneliness or speculation. The story is populated by some characters have in common try to go forward as best as possible, either looking for achieving their dreams or helping others to achieve them. The start of the film is something heavy, and the viewer takes in adapted forms of Camus, takes to enter fully into the fabric. The script has ups and downs, there is some sub-plots and diffuse characters (as that of Antonio de la Torre and Marián Aguilera), that distract without contributing anything to the set of the film. The scenes of cycling are very well achieved, and passed a great credibility and verisimilitude. A few solid players are those who finish contribute to the film the necessary consistency, although it is true that Oscar Abbot and Marián Aguilera them is still something green.Obviously the Prado of the stars is not or by far one of the most successful works of Mario Camus, but continues to be a pleasant and interesting proposal see. Hopefully this good premiere of Spanish cinema in 2008 (although entered in the Goya last year) is a positive omen for the rest of the season.</body>
