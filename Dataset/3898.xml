	<summary>Kind of remake improved blind love, The heartbreak kid is proof that we are still the Farrelly and that together with the factory Apatow is overpopulation of superheroes from more acojonante laughter in the history of cinema.</summary>
	<body>The heartbreak kid is the best movie of the Farrelly (which closed its trilogy of perfect comedies after Kingpin and something happens with Mary) in a long time.Managers shed his soft side, that side tontuna which ruined almost all of its recent proposals (except may that stuck to you), to give us ration and average of bad taste and canine humor. To make us laugh and grief in equal parts and to forget any shred of normalcy and correction, yuppie!Eddie Cantrow is a Bachelor wretched spent time with his father's seventy-seven years (Jerry Stiller giving free rein to his wild side) and with his colleague jerk always, one of these secondary (and in this movie there are a handful of them) that only the Farrelly are capable of creating for the screen.After a five year relationship that ended in nothing, he falls for a perfect girl at first sight, that he married a few weeks and begins heading to honeymoon Mexico. A moon of honey which will become a nightmare so real and full of bad taste destroyer that hurts, as it should be.Compulsive marriage has been de much of the criticism and the American public for not being fun: don't forget that there either they laugh with the Woody Allen movies or just love with the John Carpenter, so after reading the reviews and reviews of the movie already I knew (and I was not wrong) that probably I would meet a peli1 - quite cerda2 - enough amoral3 - quite enhanced remake of blind love largaEspecieThe heartbreak kid is proof that we are still the Farrelly and that together with the Apatow factory form the overpopulation of superheroes from more acojonante laughter of the history of the Cine.Y despite being one hundred fifteen minutes passes as a sigh thanks in part to these wonderful soundtracks of the brothers, that you sneak up to the VenegasPD Juliet: See credits</body>
