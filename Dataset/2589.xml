	<body>If I'm honest I have to admit that I only like two movies of the tejano, El Mariachi and The Faculty.El rest of his filmography has good jokes (Desperado), bad jokes (the Mexican), child film saga (Spy Kids or Sharkboy and Lavagirl), remakes of remakes (open until dawn) and noir with verbiage (Sin city). Is therefore very normal for Planet Terror, after a second viewing, is almost the best movie of its director for a server.Of time begins with Machete, that would even be better to imagining what you, an orgy of violence and blood, a feast as bright as shabby, a joy that perhaps should not filming or at least to shoot new scenes "big", because I've already seen the movie in the trailer. Anyway, as I say, it's great.However, it is difficult to resist Rose McGowan dancing in a bar with miniskirt, so the thing well, starts to view once you discover that it is not to be the specialty of the House?Stooges military, a lethal virus and a lot of old-school-horror in the form of makeup and LaTeX into action while introduces us to the distant marriage Block, are going to live a night of nightmare.It would be a stupidity which I was one of the many brilliant film moments, so I'm not going to. It isn't at the height of Death Proof, but it would be very (very) unfair to throw it on face, because this is something else. By the way, the trailer for Machete if that is, say it above, those that aren't are the other three?</body>
