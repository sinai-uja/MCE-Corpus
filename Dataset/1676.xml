	<body>Collective works are converted into refuge and sample of concentrated talent of some directors. A film composed of 18 short films directed by filmmakers from more disparate is a good entertainment and a continuous surprise. What history I now count? And for which they did not have the possibility of seeing the film with the initial signs of each short who will direct this story? Paris and love. Synonyms. With that premise is organized a film with all love stories. Newly married couples and well divorced marriages. I wish and conquer. Brutal and shy love. All of this can be found in this collective work in which Wes Craven and Isabel Coixet directed. Olivier Assayas and Alexander Payne. Directed by Tom Tykwer and Vincenzo Natali.Me is difficult to do a review on a movie with so many independent stories. Obviously does not speak for all of them, but if you say that they intended to be a kaleidoscope of love, fraternal relations, paternofiliales, the home of all or the end of a vital stage.Arguably, it is the perfect candidate to like everyone. At least in some fragments. There are all kinds. Less gore. Creo.parece the film travels with copies made in a different way. Which I could watch had no initial posters, so it was added an entertainment: guess who might be each short.I particularly prefer the stories directed by Oliver Schmidt and Tom Tykwer.Y for those who have seen what are yours?</body>
