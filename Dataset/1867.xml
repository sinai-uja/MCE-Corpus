	<summary>A beautiful movie, with magnificent games camera and excellent aesthetic finish. Sorry to not respond to the story in a more reliable manner.</summary>
	<body>After directing a few years ago the baleful shadowing of dawn of the dead, Zack Snyder received a poisoned candy that could catapult his faltering career or sink it definitely Warner. The American picked up the glove and assumed the leadership of the umpteenth the film adaptation of a comic book of success, moreover, achieving a result acceptable oddball. The box-office success in its premiere, which achieved a revenue of almost $ 28 million in a single day, caused it not repaired in media for the global promotion of the film.Protest of Iran to UNESCO as offensive image showing of the Persians has helped feed the curiosity and therefore to increase the expectation already alone had produced the premiere of the film. Grosso mode, 300 recounts the battle of Thermopylae in which a small number of Spartans fought against the multitudinous troops of the Persians, causing the Union of Greeks against the invaders with his heroic performance. A very elaborate aesthetics, an easily intelligible argument and a quite sober interpretation are the main virtues of the production.On the negative side, a little in keeping with the whole soundtrack and remember in excess to productions as a Gladiator or similar, artificially lengthened footage and the lack of historical accuracy in the story of the story both in the characterization of the characters. Perhaps in this has been able to influence the lack of experience of the director, who has preferred to err on the side of conservative than of avant-garde. With everything and this, 300 is a good movie, very showy, with an impeccable aesthetic finish and some superb camera games. Arguments more than enough to see it.</body>
