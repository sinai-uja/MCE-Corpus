	<summary>A pelli is not for children (despite the fantasy), though it may be a little sad, worth seeing by far.</summary>
	<body>Did not want to let go long or intoxicated me to see this Mexican production, USA and Spanish, targeted (and written and produced) by the Mexican Guillermo del Toro recently critically acclaimed and it seems that also by the public. And I liked it much.I think that it is better to not know nothing of the plot to enjoy it fully, but yes you can know that it is set in a farmhouse in post-war times, and that it mixes fantasy with reality.At first it took me getting into it, because the beginning is slow. The first fantastic developments are not what I expected either, until the real part of the story is improving to acquire genuine ownership of the tape. In the last third are already played both worlds, with the public in the Pocket by completing a round story.I liked the actors. Sergi López making national captain is too exaggerated in their evil, but is a very bad bad film in every rule. It has both nazi touch which seems or Spanish (will be a way of beating the academics of Hollywood for the Oscars?). The girl, very well. You think and makes it us believe. More things I liked: the camera transitions, very real special effects and the atmosphere in general.What not: you don't need to be so explicit in some scenes. What is not shown more impression and is more elegant. But there are a couple of very violent scenes, and some as Captain sewing it makes the hair stand on end. Care for more details. Why the character of Maribel Verdú not ends the captain when just you hitting two stabbed and cut the face?In short, a movie that is not for children (despite the fantasy), though it may be a little sad, worth seeing is more than.</body>
