	<body>I know that illustrious people like Max Renn or my teacher of history of cinema largaron by unbearable and I'm going and I find a sorpresón as a piano:Tideland is one of the movies of Gilliam that I like. It has touches Solondz or Von Trier, but it is 100% Gilliam and the first half-hour is masterful.Then what happens happens, I have thought spoilear, and the movie carried slopes that character in a way acojonante, chilling, I would say. The note, kicir, Jeff Bridges is tremendous almost a decade later and Brendan Fletcher I cannot say or m3u.The case is perhaps a little acojonado, perhaps vaccinated for everything with Inland Empire running through my veins, I find myself with a touching story about the innocence from a point of view very but very son of a bitch up to look like the killing of Texas.Esta is like Lynch, to see her.</body>
