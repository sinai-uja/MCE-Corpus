	<summary>A far cry from the denunciatorio style serious and realistic "Syriana", aims at the irony and entertainment to denounce.</summary>
	<body>Andrew Niccol was surprised with their debut, this futuristic wonder called "Gattaca" (1997), and with the script for "The Truman show" (98), since as producer directs and writes the irregular but interesting "S1m0ne" (02). Now Andrew Niccol with "Lord of war" ('Lord of War') joins a Nicolas Cage (also producer) committed to the project. "Niccol writes, directs and produces.""Lord of war" is a very cynical comedy, the protagonist is the New York-bred Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), a Ukrainian arms dealer. It shows his ascension in the arms trade. And it has no waste. Sell Israeli weapons to the Muslims, he dismantles the factories of Ukrainian weapons after the fall of the URS to sell them to Africans. With Osama bin Laden was not working because it delivered checks without funds. The word too many.The opening sequence is a statement of principles, the follow-up to a bullet since it is made unless it is fired. Acid and denunciatoria film (Yuri is an illegal dealer, but "legal" traffickers are well portrayed), always she is cold and distant with what counts, does not take party, leaves the Viewer to think, and coming from Hollywood is not very common. They seconded to Cage, Jared Leto, Ethan Hawke, Bridget Moynahan and Ian Holm.Muy away from the serious and realistic denunciatorio style of "Syriana", aims at the irony and entertainment to denounce.</body>
