	<body>Faithful to my Mania see the trilogy of Star Wars of upside down (as I saw the first time I did), today I have been visionando the episode V, "the Empire strikes back" the best Star Wars movie according to fans and geeks of the saga of George Luca$.Well it is true that in the recently edited trilogy on DVD it has managed the image and sound quality is excellent, the changes of which I already talked when fell the trilogy in my hands has made that perhaps this the favorite movie of the fans, now, with these improvements quite more attractive.And that when rereleased improved many of the things we had seen in the original movies, however, now with the touches things change (for the better) but you have to backtrack from what I said earlier.Are few, but well avenidos the inserted touches, but not River the end result.Finally, for which even not have ventured you to see the film, once again, very recommendable without a doubt.</body>
