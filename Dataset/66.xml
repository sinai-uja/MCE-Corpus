	<body>There are very good, good, bad, very bad films, signals, etc. There are films that appeal to a group of people with certain criteria, these same to another group makes them vomit. But there are movies that, regardless of whether you like or not, you have to say "what peliculón". This is one of them.The film is about the different racial factions in the city of Los Angeles. A collision of initial car, leads to a plot incredible how people interact and as each of our acts ends up triggering some events or other. A xenophobic police, another pardillo, a pair of black thieves, a pair of white "respectable", an inspector with ideals, a good Hispanic, a Persian (Iranian) a little schizophrenic, etc. Each and every one of them is related to a specific event of the film. And that is all about.It is impossible to explain this film. This must be seen. It gives very bad feeling, during almost all of it, to the point of wanting to stop seeing her. But I have to take off the hat and say, often peliculón. The plot is intertwined in an incredible way, without making heavy but it is distressing. The actors are sublime, in roles of horrible people that have been absorbed by an unjust and cruel city. And the script is great, do more I can say?In short, a very tough film with a masterful script and an incredible development. Just a nice scene, in which I cried like a Magdalene. That wonder.</body>
