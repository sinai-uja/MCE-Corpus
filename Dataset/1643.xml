	<summary>Your script will delight lovers of action cinema, since it presents all the ingredients for not leaving anyone indifferent, and as varied scenes and already classic of the 007 saga that is impossible to forget what we have before our eyes.</summary>
	<body>Taking advantage of its output on DVD I used to watch her back, it is curious that one when it envisages for the second time a film is can stop in scenes that previously left pass and even deepen elsewhere, in one way or another, had no relevance than previously thought.I'm still thinking that Eva Green, with his interpretation of Vesper Lynn, fails to give any entity such as Bond girl, leaving light years from any which previously were the most famous in the world of the celluloid 007 agent partner.Daniel Craig with his bond is the archetype of the character that we know now, giving a dimension different from the 007 classic, this bond is hard, little thuggish and more enamoradizo than the old.On the other hand, his script will delight lovers of action cinema, as it presents all the ingredients for not leaving anyone indifferent, and as varied scenes and already classic of the 007 saga that is impossible to forget what we have before our eyes.Curious, on the other hand, the scene of the game of Poker, where planning and his excellent shooting manages to remain in tension into something very trivial, as it is a game of chance.Sincerely, a tape that deserves one viewing.</body>
