	<body>The pool dives in which the girl of water, is transformed by minutes, since his original foreword until its final moral, in an ocean full of findings and successes make the new film by M. Night Shyamalan a whimsical fantasy. Because with his latest Shyamalan, who is first and foremost a great Narrator, he has risked more than ever; Girl with water is a tale known unfinished; and remember the ancient oral stories, those that they invented on the young marchaLa of the water history of improvised and elongated, is a fiction about the fear we all have inside to assume our responsibilities, for which Shyamalan proposes as an antidote, as you would with the forest, the unity of the community. But, on this occasion, the result is rather unsuccessful, not only because it allows some of his best ideas will dilute in the plot, perhaps by disjointed; but above all because it expresses his philosophy by resorting to a caricature of the characters and situations of a no-brainer alarming. Too naive, even to be a story.</body>
