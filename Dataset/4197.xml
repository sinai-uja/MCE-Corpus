	<body>With great enthusiasm, I went to see the crimes of Oxford, with the illusion of an admirer of Alex de La Iglesia, one of the directors with more talent in this country; first of all a great film lover as evidenced by some of his most acclaimed tape "hitchcocknianas" sequences. Pity that in the film that concerns us, the orondo director has been far from the day of the beast or the community. And is that in this film fails almost everything. The casting fails miserably. No one believed the couple "Frodo"-Watling. Which fails really is American actor, with a role which fits great (and I am not referring to the height of Elijah) and thumping next to the much more appropriate John Hurt. Failure the obsession of Alex shoot based on close-up and convert the tape in one of those "already the see her den when on television". The plot fails. Gives the impression that the director had been halfway between a personal film and a commercial without more pretensions, where the resolution of some points is hasty and where alternate scenes placed with shoehorn (some sequences of bed are even foolish) with others performed without any conviction by actors. Only some shots of his style - the fake plane sequence and the scene of the concert that reminds the man that he knew too much (The Man Who Knew Too Much of Alfred Hitchcock, 1956) - and the music, very similar to what Bernard Herrmann was saved to tape to qualify her mediocre and not bad.</body>
