	<body>"The last King of Scotland" is United to the tonic Hollywood of chastising facts with an end guess social complaint, although there are some who say that for political ends.As I have just said, based on real events, this film tells a formidable display the time in which General Idi Amin Dada was to the power of Uganda.El climax of the film becomes overwhelming for the Viewer, although probably is due to the colorful interpretation of Forest Whitaker, which has earned him an oscar and without which certainly complicity with the viewer that I always speakIt would not be the same.At times the film has managed to absorb in the oppressive situation that arises. I must point out the makeup and the soundtrack, especially this last is probably one of the best I've heard so far during the itself interpretation of all actors is actually achieved and except the Forest there are none on exit from another, all are great, there is a constant pulse between the characters, something that as a viewer fills muchisn't just an actor playing a role, is a character showing the vital crisis of its existence, and all these existencialidades are mixed at a key moment for the life of all of them.It is one of the films of this year you must see. I therefore recommend its viewing.For more geeks will tell that Gilliam Anderson Ex Agent Scully, has small membership. Of blonde and extremely thin (eat a pucherito Gilliam, thus not molas).</body>
