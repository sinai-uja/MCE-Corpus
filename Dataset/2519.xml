	<body>Something is happening at DreamWorks studios. From the great Shrek that continue down the level every year. Starting with Finding Nemo (which is quite good), passing through El Espanta sharks (forgettable), Shrek 2 (loose) until you reach this Madagascar, the point most low and that further pronounces the downfall of the study. Pixar relame.The characters are so endearing in any of the latest animation movies, voices are nice (is Sacha Baron Cohen) and up the lion bears a resemblance to the factions of the great comedian Ben Stiller. The problem through a script too bland - and that there are four writers-well that begins during the stay of the animals in the zoo and then stalls when the players made the landing on the dream island. And we are less than half of the film.The features are some good isolated gags that make a disjointed film at times, an animation close by movements to characters from the Warner and designed almost exclusively to children (that bad that we got used with Shrek!) But in the end not us so critical of a movie without intentions - apparently - transcend.The best are the anarchistic penguins led by a such Joe almost deserving of a film's protagonists. Happy to very little. The final moral is that if the Lion can not eat meat, we give fish and ready (while not to eat Nemo is all good).</body>
