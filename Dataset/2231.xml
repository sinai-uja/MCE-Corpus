	<body>"Harry Collings returns home after wandering with his friend, Arch." His wife, who had given him missing, allows to stay together to it believing that everything would be as before. But then Harry has to make a difficult decision regarding their loyalties and priorities.Interesting revisionist western is not narrated in the usual way. It is made with few resources and fewer characters. However, although strange sometimes, it contains scenes full of passion and good movies. It is quite irregular, but it is worth seeing her. Verna Bloom is great and Warren Oates, immeasurable. Good and very nice music. Anecdotally, tell that when I saw in the film Burceña (Barakaldo, Bizkaia) gave us the first two rolls changed, i.e., we knew how terminated without knowing how it started.Us looking all surprised, then we descojonamos and accepted. We are all human.</body>
