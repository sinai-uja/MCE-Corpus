	<body>Oliver Stone has always been characterized by the strong political charge that surrounds each of his appearances, and which on occasions has moved to his films. It is a famous of those that stands critical of the system, although in the majority of cases Republicans are the target of their acidic comments. Like other peers, has positioned itself against the aggressive and coercive stance his country adopted after the September 11 attacks, the bloodiest in history (not counting the perpetrators on behalf of the States). Does this time, Stone leave aside his political vein? social and focuses on the story of John McLoughlin and William Jimeno, two officers of the port authority of New York for his work to help evacuate the towers become trapped under the rubble after the collapse of the same. The anguish of families and the hard work of the team in turn covered bail them out they are the linchpin of the argument. Regardless of the reality of the drama that reflects World Trade Center is a fairly weak, boring movie and which might well fit into the television table of weekends.The interpretative aspect, Nicolas Cage is immutable and hieratic, for a change, while the rest either highlights too. At least the families of those affected by the infamous terrorist act will see some of the benefits that this "chestnut" to produce, even if only five percent of the box office in the first weekend of its premiere in United States; one-tenth of what it spent on promotion and nothing compared with what Stone is received. But clear, it all makes for sensitivity with victims. Money is secondary. Or so it says. Do not believe?.</body>
