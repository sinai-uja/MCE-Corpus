	<summary>It is not so comedy as one might expect (one smile 2 or 3 times, slightly), or as dramatic as it appears in the argument, has its moments and little more, simple, well made and shot, but despite being well implemented becomes something plumbate.</summary>
	<body>This is one of those romantic comedies where one wonders if, the taste for the writers and actors goes far beyond the proposal that is seen on the screen or it wants to deepen "more beyond", a tape that is easy to see the tape and feeling hungry, as well as a huge desire to cookIndeed, comparisons with the great "Ratatouille" Pixar are amazing, and in some moments he hoped to see the protagonist of the last wonder of interpretive plot Pixar.En rateta, both Catherine as Aaron, do not reach you the heels to Abigail Breslin (who turned 10 years during filming), girl that we discover in "Little Miss Sunshine" and here is a part of the weight of the action, but everytime he appears on-screen eclipse 2 adults, much more interested in look good, to give his characters; and that Catherine tries, a dimension different from the previously conceived.We in the city, once again we have with one character, while action is always developed in the restaurant where she works the character of Catherine, on the other hand, and driven by the impulses of this cuisine, they may be the best moments where it appears with his therapist where this has the best performance.I loved the soundtrack by Philip Glass, which, although it includes numerous items of Opera, has a main theme that accompanies the protagonists for much of the footage, incidentally this reserves a cameo in a bar near the end of the film.In short: Is not so comedy as one might expect (one smile 2 or 3 times, slightly), or as dramatic as it appears in the argument, has its moments and little more, simple, well made and shot, but despite being well implemented becomes something plumbate.</body>
