	<summary>It has everything you need to a horror film: House grade and damn, asshole characters down to the basement and blood, much blood.</summary>
	<body>While it is true that the drunk I got watching this film I disables input to speak of it, more true it is that the film frykandéliko can see serene, and much less if you're a person balanced. "I, as I am an unbalanced and in addition a drunken man confessed, enjoyed in my sofa, throne of the humble, this film of our amado-odiado favorite film speculator, Lucio Fulci.""The House next to the cemetery", crappy without the possibility of recovery shot in 1981, offers us the face more poetic and intuitive Italian "Director". Visual allegories, poetic rhythm and attempts of emotional intensity discover us that Fulci is also human, though, to not fuck his reputation, it offers us also, especially when the scripts flojean (or are blatantly tasteless), scenes of good and free gore, pain, suffering and sadism.The argument is not much, taking all need a horror film. Do home grade and damn, asshole characters that are relegated to the basement when it is clear that "something" happens, cute girl, child sometimes looks dead and blood, much worse sangre.¿Lo? That at times bored greatly, especially when he tries to give an impossible plot depth to the story and, more importantly, depth no one demanded, do or perhaps someone is going to see a movie by Fulci for his spiritual background? the best? When Fulci is Fulci and is dedicated to generate fear and to take guts, which is all that is worth this man. Good movie to see with colleagues.</body>
