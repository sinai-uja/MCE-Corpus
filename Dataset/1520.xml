	<summary>Sofia Coppola has been with the mantra that the minimum stories can be great stories, but theirs has become a minimum account of a potential great story.</summary>
	<body>Trying to live a successful, that not a great film, lost in translation, can create the false hope that whatever comes afterwards is just as good. The pompous world of Marie Antoinette is the Titanic of Sofia Coppola, only that this time, the film if it capsizes.This new experiment, supposedly irreverent to use totally outdated songs in the film, portraying Marie Antoinette from your link for convenience until his last days.One of the virtues of the great directors and screenwriters is that they can become a story allegedly boring something slightly entertaining and passable, but in this case it has turned upside down.This vehicle for showcasing of the Director and the lead actress who becomes one of the most boring films of the current panorama. An outstanding art direction that is left as a protagonist of a vacuous speech. As the protagonist. It's amazing how with little effort (in direct and write) a character can turn someone totally heinous, superficial and without interest.It gives the impression that Sofia Coppola has been with the mantra that the minimum stories can be great stories, but theirs has become a minimum account of a potential great story.A penalty.</body>
