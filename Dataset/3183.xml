	<body>Of all the films that passed through Sitges 2007, The Fall was which won the award for best film and which perhaps better talked about the fantasy genre. The Indian director Tarsem Singh (who now signs just as Tarsem) already had with worlds of fantasy in the cell. It was a visually perfect Ribbon, with a really successful style. But the content was very vacuous, it was a little child that mix of macabre images were the mind of a serial killer. And with his new film, Tarsem returns to fall slightly in the same mistake, neglecting the content of a story that it could have expanded a little more. The Fall is about a girl that is in a hospital for a broken arm, and goes to visit a man who has been entered by a broken leg. Is trafficking of a specialist cinema, which will explain to the girl a few fantastic stories.This film focuses above all on the history explained by the boy, leaving aside what happens (or happened) in the life of both protagonists. There are too many scenes focusing on teaching what tells the boy, and in some passage - especially in the second half - the story of the heroes is something repetitive. But Tarsem offers Visual wonders with each plane, forcing the colors or getting precious prospects &hellip; The Fall is mesmerizing, and the viewer will foolishly as the girl who hears the story. This small interpreter, Catica Untaru, makes his role with a quite unusual naturalness. And, on the other hand, also deserve special attention the sequence that opens the film, a feat to slow and full of gray black and a white.</body>
