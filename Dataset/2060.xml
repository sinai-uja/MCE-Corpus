	<body>Class B the Marvel character. Nicolas Cage desperate for portraying a superhero, after what they ningunearan with Superman. Director of the not very well-received Daredevil, Mark Steven Johnson. In other words, this painted for a total fiasco.But it wasn't like that. Lejísimos masterpieces of the comic as Batman Returns or Spider-man 2, Hellboy, Ghost Rider is another good adaptation of the famous comics, Daredevil sister by its rhythm and Cadence, and relies on an attractive story featuring a character with special characteristics. Above attempts such as Elektra, Hulk and some other more.This cool motoquero Ghost has its good things. With cyber western wave, its 110 minutes pass quite fast despite the fact that the special effects are simple, not as it is customary in this genre and its waste.I.e., they are not the big thing but they meet. Lack of budget? Likely. Unknown Eva Mendez is another Latin which is for murder, the bike is impressive, the character transformations are very successful and Peter Fonda as the devil zafa. Up there just.Criticism shattered and the box office are burning, i.e. already scheduled the sequel for 2009 which will be more action as already presented the character.Now a thing: Nicolas Cage sobreactúa all the time for a change, still as heavy as usual and that ugly toupee! please</body>
