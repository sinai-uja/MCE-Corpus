	<summary>Seedy science fiction film. In short, it is short (70´) and is long.</summary>
	<body>"A scientist sends to find a young journalist to make ECHO into the world of an event like no other: an unknown planet is approaching the Earth, with the consequent risk of upheaval." One day, discovered that a ship has fallen close to where they live, discover with amazement that a stranger be is inside. "They don't know if it is friend or foe, so it will try to establish communication with him."The criticism has always said the tape is a good work of series B. In my opinion is pure Z series, with two dollars, and noticing in excess. For starters, its history is nothing another Thursday, although perhaps in his time was. Then we can talk about the endearing (by shoddy) decorated. They sing is an outrage. And the rest, little thing. In short, it is short (70´) and is long.</body>
