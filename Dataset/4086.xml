	<summary>You will like: If you a "snobbish" with glasses of pasta you are going through life as "sobrao", you will not like if the stories that have to do with the life of a stupid whippersnapper you matter less than you think.</summary>
	<body>The film seeks to be a strange mixture of comedy (a single minute I not laughed) and intense DRAMA (have either cried or felt bad roll), a tape that combines the world of cartoons with actors who interpret the characters and also the real characters, so forming a stranger "Hodgepodge – Underground" surely that like all those who feel identified with that other kind of comic that not tells the exploits superhero.The film has took brand new in Spain, in the USA it did at the beginning of the year 2004 and the truth is that, as I said when I saw "Entre Copas", actor Paul Giamatti is the center of function, and besides the driver link in history!Cone, who is the protagonist! this sensational, showing that cruel and merciless face has Harvey Peckard, the address is sober, the picture carefully and that soundtrack that surrounds the film true smell Jazz makes it curious, that if. !Experiments at home and with raincoat! (I think that I have bostezado of pure boredom as a dozen times during the projection).You will like: If you're a "snob" with glasses of pasta you are going through life as "sobrao" (see stick I'm going to bring to this), you will not like if the stories that have to do with the life of a stupid whippersnapper you matter less than you think.Curious, but so boring that you mirarás over and over again the clock waiting for that hour and 37 min. tape to pass as quickly as possible.</body>
