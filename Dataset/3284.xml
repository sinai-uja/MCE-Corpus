	<body>Damn friends! Occasionally do us unforgivable things. I'm here to witness the gruesome quarter SAW and I do not just mean to incite terror, in any case caused me bored. Obviously it was played to them to choose the movie, so I went directly to the slaughterhouse to see the new crap that occur them in the new release.The DARREN LYNN BOUSMAN returned to again make a mess with their continuous movements of camera, the film seems orchestrated by a fucking blind monkey rhythm of video-clip. Such was in charge of the direction of the Remake of SCANNERS. Poor DAVID CRONEMBERG should be swearing in several dead languages.The same lousy actors of a saga that they eat hot thanks to her that no one else will hire outside SAW. In is occasion the despelote starts from the beginning, in full autopsy are with a tape embedded in the stomach of the psychopath. Take horse chestnut! But is every moment the thing is worse.Characters that appear and disappear to the free will, increasingly more ridiculous tricks and again one final surprise really insane that her not believed anyone not drunk. Photography, music, actors direction is again of kindergarten, leaving a single powerful time is the annotated autopsy, pure curiosity for lovers of gore. Else more than enough, the worst is that probably are new parts per roll.</body>
