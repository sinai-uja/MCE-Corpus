	<summary>American hypocrisy in its purest form, from the hand of the cynic par excellence of this side of the Atlantic, Antonio Banderas.</summary>
	<body>Don't feel special filia by the cinema of social complaint, because it is usually an interested complaint that does not show the reality of things, but what interests in the face of a box office or knows what interests. If above Antonio Banderas is put out there, the degree of credibility that I deserve decreases even more. City of silence recounts the tragic events that for years affect Ciudad Juarez, where it seems that you a business political oligarchy campa to rampant and thousands of women are killed without that nobody seems to have or the slightest interest to clarify the crimes.This complaint, as is often common in American cinema, is presenting us to an almost wild Mexico as opposed to a civilized and magnificent United States. While it is true that it refers to corruption on both sides of the border, you do differently good, as if they were normal in the case of Mexicans, accepted, while it is something special to happen in the country that electrocute convicts or simply imprisons them indefinitely and without trial.Jennifer Lopez is still as bland and anticipada that always, and now it continues to believe that having the back in place and suffice also for films. Flags, little to say; Once again it makes Mexican on a film that distills hypocrisy on all four sides.Because I will not be who argue that they worry about Mexican women working in subhuman conditions, but so far its only measure has been staying with the money have brought you to a film that exploits the drama. Incidentally, what is the film itself is unstructured, boring, lack of pace and heavy watch. Once again, the "based on true facts" that appears at the beginning, was a bad omen.</body>
