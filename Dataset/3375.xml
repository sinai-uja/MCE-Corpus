	<body>About a decade ago the Norwegian director unknown PAL SLETAUNE premiered with huge impact including a nomination for the Academy Award as best foreign language film "The postman in love" A sort between comedy and Thriller made with great freshness in a tour of dry violence surprised to be an unusual film.The Norwegian film is obviously not too popular, virtually is complicated high that something done around here comes to Spain. It is therefore normal that he lost track of this interesting author.Look out where two years later comes in 2007 another title of the author in is occasion could be categorized as a horror film, or at least reach unattainable terrifying limits in genuine proposals of the genre.An enclosed space that encourages the craustofobia characters on the edge of madness played masterfully by young performers who made their debut in the film although they have a comprehensive curriculum on television. Sadomasochism is shown in full boiling in a wild script that encourages the blood from the first moment.A paragon of virtues in the dark photography, a music that helps in this Web of great darkness that surrounds a Halo sick of Frank decadence into something that can only end in tragedy.Sex is totally destructive in the big premiere of the season which unfortunately happens to the cruel anonymity.The Norwegian film walks of congratulations after the also brilliant Thriller URO's next release.</body>
