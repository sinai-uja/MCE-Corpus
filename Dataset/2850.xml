	<body>Excellent comedy Spanish of the late 1990s, El milagro de p. Tinto has 1. A simple humor, another rather violent, visual, surprise, and a third a bit more excruciating, which includes social commentary not naïve, although without reaching the cinismo.2. An enviable production and, above all, a careful absolute aesthetic, where art and photography desulmbran by its beauty, tidiness and surprise in the context of a comedy of this ilk (I say, Comedy Comedy, that make people laugh out loud, and not comedy drama or comedy, which outlines smiles). 3. The best faces I saw in a long time in the film, and also excellent performances. In other words, a casting of puta madre.In short, a film more, much more than recommended.</body>
