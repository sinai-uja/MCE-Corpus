	<body>This small española-estadounidense co-production is a decent science fiction film set today, and without the need of great special effects, ends up being a pretty solid film. The film tells the story of David Norton, who travels with his fiancée, to give a lecture on an island; However, the trouble begins when his girlfriend commits suicide inexplicably.Norton confusion increases when he realizes account at the same time on the island have been going a series of unexplained suicides and that his trip to the island is immersed in a plan much more sinister; to discover the truth only count with the help of the only survivor of these suicides which is able to remember because he decided to throw out a window.The film combines conspiracy theories and illegal experiments of the X Files type and history can be seen fairly easily; However never stands out as a gem of the genre and even though the central idea has some traits of originality the execution of the film is fairly conventional but at least serves to have a good time. Three stars.</body>
