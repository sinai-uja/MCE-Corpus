	<body>A few years after Danny Boyle directed one of the best and original horror films today, the Spanish Juan Carlos Fresnadillo advocates "28 weeks later", a sequel to it that does not reach his level.The story puts us back in London but focuses on a family separated by tragedy. The father (played by Robert Carlyle) takes over the great regret of having left his wife in the middle of a matanza-zombi and tries to change his life with the help of their children in a city that has been rebuilt, "cleansed" and controlled by the United States. However, a new threat looms to the protagonists.In this film are cared for details of his predecessor, on the basis of the address in a point of view similar to a documentary. Fresnadillo adds to this a much darker tone without a small glimmer hope, with much more macabre sequences and getting to really give us fear (the first ten minutes are really frightening). The interpretation of Robert Carlyle is really fascinating and the picture is very good, with completely engulfed into chaos London planes. However, just as its predecessor was a good change towards the second half of the film, this remains constant during all the time doing that in an attempt to not very well spent for Fresnadillo and with the feeling that we have been "more of the same" stay to the end.Therefore, is a story that continues well its predecessor, making us spend a harrowing and terrifying time: a good attempt of Fresnadillo but lacking original ideas.</body>
