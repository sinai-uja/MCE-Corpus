	<summary>Painful aftermath of the grossing tape Spanish, there is no where grab.</summary>
	<body>I could not go to the pass of press of this do film? and as I understand it would have fit anyway, not because of my size or my fat, but because they were 4 monkeys to see, now I used to take a look, and the truth is that I'm glad not having lost one morning, the tape, to say the least, full of cameos in the purest style "Torrent" (remember they share protagonist)is a pigswill with a non-existent argument; reminds me of when we were small and we started to play anything in plan do vale now such?, as well. The script seems written by a child of 2 years with a joint in hand, and one liter of beer in the other, a Wyoming and a Kira Mir√≥ more linear than the dual carriageway, and stripes with Pilar Rubio, which only known for his appearances in "The sixth" as a villain on duty.Ah, by the way, the film is the posthumous work of Coll J.L., rest in peace, back in the sky, the hand of the great Tip.</body>
