	<body>These actors stuck to directors, as Clooney in "good night and good luck", flags, or De Niro, it seems that they directed so that we know that they are not stupid. "The good Shepherd" speaks of the threads of history that have led us to where we are, the threads that move the world, equal than "Syriana", or "Lord of war". All of them seek to be difficult. The postmodern style seems to be abuse of the intelligent ellipsis; on the assumption that the Viewer is a star guy. The postmodern director does not explain, presupposes that we're back everything, it anticipates our anticipations. And I think that it is high time to claim a film easier.De Niro begins the film pose a mystery. The CIA was defeated at Bay of pigs because Fidel Castro had a snitch. While Damon investigates who was, history makes a tour, not entirely essential, by the past of the protagonist, and the birth of the Department of intelligence during the second war Mundial.Si forget the secondary plots, which is easy to do thanks to their endless proliferation, the film poses a moral dilemma between the homeland and the heart or between duty and happiness. Nonetheless be disturbing, but it responds too paternalistic. Hands like these, the end "Romeo and Juliet" would become a lesson for Brats children, and parents of the Capuleto and the Montesco would be the heroes.</body>
