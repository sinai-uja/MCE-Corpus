	<summary>A drama not seeking the easy tear but yes manages to thrill with their development.</summary>
	<body>Richard Eyre (forbidden beauty, suddenly last summer) returns to the fray with a new passionate drama in which boasts two heavyweights of the interpretation, such as Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett, both winners of the statuette from the Academy for his roles in Shakespeare in love and Elizabeth, respectively. Diary of a scandal tells the story of Barbara (Judi Dench), a lonely and churlish Professor of secondary London experienced a radical change in his life when appears Sheba, the new master of art in the school (Blanchett). They immediately engaged in a deep friendship and Barbara finds therein the confidant that had never before. But when discovers that her new friend remains a heated affair with one of his students feels betrayed and decides to go public with the news, causing a series of chain reactions that just leaving bare the deepest secrets, lies and obsessions of their lives.Diary of a scandal is a magnificent film, based on a solid and sober screenplay written by Patrick Marber (The Closer), and above all the excellence acting of its protagonists, two of the best actresses in the world for quite some time. The ability to express feelings and ideas without getting to say them at any time is one of the characteristics that European cinema has maintained as a distinctive note with respect to the American giant, along with a more leisurely tempo and the excellent handling of the silences that invite reflection. And, in many cases, it shows. And not little.</body>
