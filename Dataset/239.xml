	<summary>Entertaining film for the personal showcasing of Vin Diesel</summary>
	<body>This Vin Diesel rare makes to me with hair. And face fool that you have. By the way, the sofa in the cell is true, it is good.The film is a mafioso who is jailed for reasons which are not the case. While in prison, is involved in one of the biggest legal cases of the United States. In it, he accuses an entire family of 76 posts (well, variaditos). As Vin Diesel belongs to that family, also drop you something. Total that each character in the family has a lawyer, except Vin who decides that he will defend him alone. And so, without knowing laws, is dedicated to crazy to the Prosecutor and the judge at the same time to enrapture the jury.Indeed, the film is nice. Vin Diesel shows that it is not only a bag of muscles, if that has no more records as an actor. It embodies a sympathetic mobster who is disowned by his family (mobster) but that he, as a man of honour defends them. The pace is somewhat slow, with fun moments but with many authentic roll. The script makes interesting, more in the case of a real case. This makes us doubt much of the usefulness of the jurors, given that a simple graciosillo can tip the balance of justice. The other characters do very well, although they are unknown entirely.In short, entertaining film for the personal showcasing of Vin Diesel. In addition, it gives us the possibility of reviving the longest trial up to that point.</body>
