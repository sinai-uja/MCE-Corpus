	<body>"Michael Klienhouse is the typical neighbour model, married and with a child." One day, on the morning of the day of Holocaust, Michael collides with the car of Dreyfus. Tamar, the wife of Michael, makes an obscene gesture to Dreyfus and this accelerates your vehicle and crashes into the open door of Michael, being about to strike at Tamar. As a good citizen, Michael hopes to resolve the situation with the help of the authorities, but turns out the sixties Dreyfus, a former war hero, is a violent man well-connected and influential friends. Michael, which is mired in a personal crisis, it is difficult to give in to the "power", so the following days will become a real nightmare. "However, their fight against a corrupt and violent reality which endangers his life and freedom will finally breathe a new meaning to life". Entertaining film Israeli, well done although somewhat repetitive.It's an atypical history, with both physical and verbal violence, whereas something lasts in some moments from every point of view.Not bored in no time and the argument follows easily, but it is also true that everything seems a little joke and one not just believe everything that happens.However, maintains the tension at all times, with even intrigue and some suspense, but I think that you am not convinced at all at the end. By the way that the end is spectacular and there was at the International Film Festival of Donostia (2007) that saw, applause, but it is exaggerated and although plausible, incredible.I said, is not bad, but not well.</body>
