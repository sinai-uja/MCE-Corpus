	<body>Not occurred to me see "The Aviator" and is that, with all that I spoke and the times that I've met her in satellite channel, I have withdrawn, while having a copy on DVD of the film, I ventured to see her, and say this and so I start my comment of "The Departed" (I refuse to call it by the title in Spanish), order to make my small fight with the director of Queens.Es, this remake of "Infernal Affairs" all one wager well directed film better interpreted, and with a bittersweet moment that like, and much in the stalls (towards Looooong time that was not a room where not cabiera or a PIN), on the other hand, both Damon and DiCaprio are one more than substantial performance, and see that, neither are my devotion santo, although, as we know, that takes the cat to the water is Nicholson, who with their presence on screen, from the first minute of footage, one enjoys as a child with a caramel from each of their appearances histr√≠onicas; the weakest, perhaps, because so little that appears in the footage is Mark Walberg, and is that it is difficult to assume his role on screen, without emitting a sound of laughter, a face, beautiful by the way, to discover, thought me of Vera Farmiga, the girl on the film (complicated its role in a tape where "the prevailing male" takes the lead).On the other hand, and as only negative note, it would be excessive violence, with which Martin narrates the events that are happening in 2: 30 H. footage (which never suffer from heaviness, learn other directors.). Finally, a more than remarkable Thriller, which reconciles me with the director of Italian origin.</body>
