	<body>Received coldly by the public that the previous year had enjoyed a masterpiece, "The Apartment", "One, Two, Three" is a comedy film at full speed staged in the heart of the cold war, Berlin. Wilder had already spoofed the friction between Yankee and Communists in his early work as a screenwriter. In this film we have an officer from the Coca Cola in Berlin West, MacNamara, which receives commissioned to monitor the daughter of the Chief holiday for that city. The disobedient Scarlett goes to look for boyfriend to the red side, and reappears with a mozalbete respondón and versed in Marx. MacNamara sees jeopardized his position and moves his influences that they taken the boy. When the matter appears resolved, Scarlett Announces oh, horror!, is pregnant Communist. The Executive leaves to rescue the boy to marry Scarlett and, incidentally, put it "presentable" form and content. A comedy with frenetic pace, almost choreographic performances and cyclical jokes. Wilder was mocking the rigidity of the Russians and the maniac ambition of the gringos, but the first leave worse unemployed. Russians succumb to the tingling of consumerism.Sadly, the time gave him the reason.</body>
