	<summary>Of course only a greater depth in the psyche of the characters if you want but not much more. Pleasant surprise.</summary>
	<body>Open water is a quite particular film and this is for several reasons: his director Chris Kentis Debuts absolute assisted only by his wife, 120 total hours shot in video and without facts, special effects (and sharks) totally real in a film of primary terror, with an ideal length (only 79 minutes) and finally, awarded at the prestigious Sundance film festival.	 All this wouldn't say anything if open sea ended not be - as it is - a very good Opera prima low-budget, with an air of pseudo documentary, extremely effective and tasteful. A seemingly happy couple, after 40 minutes of diving is forgotten and sinks into the ocean, miles from the Mainland, in a shark infested water, the storyline.The increase in tension and the psychology of the own partner van in crescendo, with a precise mounting up to a beautiful, surprising and poetic end. Of course only a greater depth in the psyche of the characters if you want but not much more. Pleasant surprise.</body>
