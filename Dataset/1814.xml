	<summary>The number 23 is a poorly exploited idea, while the home is excellent and the first minutes make you illusions to a ravishing Ribbon of suspense, this becomes a bluff, in a kind of moral that pica of one hundred different sources and not delves into nothing.</summary>
	<body>There are 2 different types of Jim Carrey, as if it were 2 Siamese brothers, one is Jim Carrey comedy acts, that payasete that either you love well (as it is my case) or you falls as a kick in the very, on the other hand we have Jim Carrey dramatic actor, that which dazzles you with movies such as "Man on the moon", "The Truman Show" or "forget about of my", that another actor that makes cuddle Oscar, to fall into his arms, but uncle Oscar who also hate Carrey; in this film Carrey left possess by the two brothers, in large part because the 2nd giving dramatic approach, too bad that at the end of the Ribbon and in the last bars sobreactúe and gesticule as if in a comedy.The number 23 is an idea poorly exploited, while the home is excellent and the first minutes make you illusions to a ravishing Ribbon of suspense, this becomes a bluff, in a kind of moral that pica of one hundred different sources and not delves into nothing, is like a small child with a dish of mealHowever much it Pecks and plays, not takes benefit of the stew.Disservice makes a painful coordination of the tape, Mr Schumacher, sincerely dediquesé to make sock, the film is is atragantando completely, with a very bad direction of actors, where each goes to his ball and where there is no feelling at any time in the development.A dark picture, a script that is eventually diffused, two areas that are trying to be different and that, as in a bad imitation of "The hours" just juntandose in a "whole" that little or has nothing to do with a finish so chorra which seems to catch with pins, cheater but not power and abrupt almost like a bus.Virginia Madsen adorable, since I I joined with her in "Entre Copas", her auguré a future filled with work, and I was not wrong or a little. Perhaps better than Carrey in any footage, giving his character (little) package you need.Of course not everything is going to be negative, at least I liked much the agile movements of camera and the "promotion" of reading (that must be read, readers mine, that but we are some sheep.).It is a tape made to generate controversy, in internet forums and in other sites of debate, as happened with "The Ring" the remake of Gore Verbinski, where every one saw that gave the win on screen.In short: as he said Sarah Connor No future, there is only that we do</body>
