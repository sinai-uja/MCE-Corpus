	<body>As you would expect from a work of Gibson, the emotion is the sustaining element of the film, being built, from this, a splendid narration.He returned to become manifest the taste by the simplicity argument, no puzzles or unexpected twists, but why not leaving a maximum interest in the Viewer. They are two hours and fourth film, however, giving the impression of eating in a sigh, this is the intensity and power attractive of the same.Games of lights, fleeting levels, impossible angles and stunning crane movements occur to put us squarely in a world where the life of an individual depends precisely on that, its speed and its expertise.As if Odysseus they were, our protagonist takes (much to his regret, that Yes) a journey of survival and improvement, where the fate, boldness and, above all, the desire to return with his family, will be your best asset.Actors are incredibly compelling, looking like, moreover, have been taken directly from a real populated maya. Their gazes, passionate, reckless and defiant, are exchanged constantly, getting so involved in this risky game that one can only be winner.As moving at the beginning of the film, a civilization cannot be destroyed if not destroyed before herself. This is precisely what reflects the film, the self-destruction of a people, of a culture, a way of life; do whose final executioners come, slowly but inexorably, through the ponto.¿Sangre? Yes, many. Dead? Yes, many. Savagery? Yes, much. Film gore? At all.In short, an excellent film, technically superb, narrativamente as simple as perfect and aesthetically beautiful. Again, and despite the criticism, chapeau, Gibson.</body>
