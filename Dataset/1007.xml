	<summary>Chronicle of an Apocalypse in the making. Impeccable model of nihilistic film, children of men poses more questions than solutions.</summary>
	<body>Impeccable model of nihilistic film, children of men poses more questions than solutions. I have already written several times that this is the nature of art. Produces anxiety, creates discomfort, induces pessimism and, however, is an ode to human life, a song beautiful, sparsely religious, although what happens can make us suspect that the moralistic side or mythological will succeed sometime: none of this happens. Intelligent hybrid of various genres (film political, science fiction, conventional thriller), children of men is an absolute Flash of light, a tenebrist and apocalyptic light so tells it (a pregnant woman driven by a former activist to view salvation has that 18 years ago that no woman is pregnant).Cuarón, who is a todotereno capable of giving life to Harry Potter, do road movies of teen sex (Y tu mamá also) and revolver casings with this fable of illegality and corruption, death and beauty, at the time, gives the target of entertainment without abandoning its nearest prontuario of metaphysical intent, namely: a world doomed to its dissolutiona world without God or Government that lives its last sky and their recent rales of tenderness.Manichaean in his final, meaningless resolution altogether of any blade of humor (or crazy character of Caine can get a smile, although it is proposed with a desire to), the film documentaliza the horror of the war, portrays the profound absurdity of the human condition with verismo (Malraux dixit) and how the love, that son fathered by women of color in a concentration camp, in the cold light of insensitive flexo ends (how to say otherwise) succeeding.</body>
