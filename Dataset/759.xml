	<summary>If by the script would be a real horror film. As Scott is the director of worship, many are left to deceive and see quality where there.</summary>
	<body>I can't imagine how was conceived "A good year" (A Good Year). Ridley Scott has just come out of a box office failure, "The Kingdom of heaven", and is about to embark on an ambitious project ("American Gangster") so the best thing is to make a simple one, cheap, fast shooting and film a genre that enjoyment of popular fervour.Finally wheel a dramatic comedy of (allegedly) romantic Court, with an attractive and charismatic protagonist such as Russell Crowe, a few women of impressive body (se ve te the Duster, Ridley), beautiful landscapes, one bike cool so the prota moves slightly (do homage to some film of his brother?), a pinch of philosophy (cheap) and a lot of dialogues (ridiculous in good measure).If by the script would be a real horror film because, being a more typical history, on top of that it is full of topics about life, love, money and other. Nothing differentiates the screenplay for this film from the of many others of similar theme aimed at adolescents.But of course, Ridley Scott is headed by and this has two implications. The first is that the film is directed with correction and has an entretenidillo pace, although the action to move forward a little to tronpicones topic in topic, which makes that the two-hour film is not excessively long (although she is to notice).The second is that, as Scott is the director of worship, many are left to deceive and see quality where there. Not dealt with by the director of masterpieces such as "Alien" or "Blade Runner" this film would have received brutal criticism sticks. Reasons would not lack.</body>
