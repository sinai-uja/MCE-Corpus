	<body>I have a couple of days chasing see this film, the first day, schedule is not commensurate with my work shifts, and sessions or began very early or they finished very late, finally today I got a hole in my busy schedule and her I have been able to watch, and my opinion may not be more unfavourable.When I saw the trailer I took to recognize Monica Bellucci, removing his electrifying femininity embedded in clothing typically male, leaving out this brutal Sex-appleal that she has on screen, and making it almost a heroine of action, thing quite silly, on the other hand, because the moans that hits during much of the footage the closer a actress X than a heroine of action cinema.Tape, another trough of pot, Jean-Christophe Grangé, author among others of "Rivers of purple" (whose first part is masterful, and whose second smacks in parathyroids to "code Da vinci") and "Pact of wolves" bad tape Jean Reno, where the alla tries to Peck of different genres without success one, from the film of intrigue, passing by the assassins in series, and even with the western.With a plot so mysterious as these best seller of rapid consumption that you hooked on reading and you disappoint in its final resolution, even though the mythical Catherine Devenue try to give an air of mystery to his role.The tape is liosa, with that plot that opens in several directions and closes at once no matter the slightest, and that spare no blood or show us spectacular bodies, but is in the end a fraud, painful and poorly built.A Bluff that comes to the screen and will happen to more punishment than glory.</body>
