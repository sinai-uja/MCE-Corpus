	<body>Disney bets by "revive" his classics, if last year we had the tasteless Lindsay Lohan at the head of the remake of "Herbie", on this occasion we have Tim Allen (who has upload to Disney through the saga of Santa Claus), at the head of this revisitación of "A very doggy candidate", the film is 100% Disney, politically correct, family, and happy ending with moralina, in times where the House of Mickey Mouse has to conform to their successes in film of real image; After his rather than famous failure in its Division of animation, with the exception of Pixar, but that's another story.History does not give for more, situations are completely known; a sample is its trailer, and performances by 90% of the casting seems to be thinking in the cheque, rather than like the audience.Anyway, that just like the smaller House, elders as much you will get boot a couple of smiles and a half hours of footage.</body>
