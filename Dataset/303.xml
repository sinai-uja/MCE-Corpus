	<summary>Typical movie of disasters, action and tension in which the characters imported little or nothing and will that if we do not expect much help us to have a good time</summary>
	<body>Last night I was one of the most promoted summer releases. This Poseidon is not a remake of the famous movie of the 1970s but a new vision of history. And I have entertained dry (uff what more wit have been ready to write.). Let's say it is the typical movie of disasters, action and tension in which the characters imported little or nothing and that if we do not expect much will serve to have a fun night of summer.Do not think that you will see something similar to Titanic. What is more, except some few levels of the ship at the beginning, at the time of the disaster and in the end, the rest are sequences of interiors, with the tiny group of characters trying to survive with minimal concession to personal relations between them.It is not that this is negative, but let us not deceive ourselves. The tension is well shot (the director is Wolfgang Petersen, of the little valued the motion perfect) and caused and almost everything is plausible. I think that the character of Richard Dreyfuss (Millionaire homosexual) entertains the majority of the public, although it is of use and tirar.Â¿No you think a pity? A shame because after an interesting start in which is about to commit suicide, minutes later gives a kick to the type argued in the elevator shaft to be saved, lol. But then they forget he and I did not hear a single line of dialogue more. And he is an actor that I think it deserves much more. The guy this thuggish with all the earmarks of Matt Dillon in something about Mary, isn't a little absurd? I gave the feeling that wanted to hire Matt, they gave pumpkins and in revenge so ridiculed with his brother (did not know to see her, but it is his brother, Kevin Dillon.)</body>
