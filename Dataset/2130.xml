	<body>The wind that shakes the barley occurs at an important time in the history of Ireland, is an effective film that achieves its purpose, which is to have that part of the story from the Irish perspective. While Ken Loach is English, their compatriots in the film do not go well unemployed, are seen as assassins and invaders in a country that was not his, not is if this actually corresponds to reality, but what matters ultimately is the quality of the film, and I think that it is well built but fails to thrill as it should, and that contains quite hard scenes that should be more impact, but do not.Cillian Murphy is the protagonist and is correct in his role, although it could perhaps have done it same or better, others are not well known actors, but everyone does a correct interpretation.In short, a film which is worth seeing, especially if you're Irish or want to understand the conflict in that country, while always taking into account the point of view is very subjective.</body>
