	<body>Since I got to read news about "Missionary Impossible III" I was with this film, almost the first tape of Michelle Monaghan, so refer to it over and over again, over and over again. The film, quite simplistic and pretending to give an "attractive" air of narration, is nothing more than clichés and clichés about the "Buddy Movies" (tapes cops that proliferated so much at the end of the 1980s and early 1990s, taking the series of Richard Donner "Lethal weapon" as a greatest exponent), and although he tries to take off ever succeeds, predictable, weak and uneven developmentHe is forgotten almost with the ease that view.In short, bread for today and hunger for tomorrow.</body>
