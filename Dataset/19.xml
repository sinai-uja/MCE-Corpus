	<summary>Good, but lacks something to be a family classic</summary>
	<body>Some youngsters come to a fantasy world called Narnia, full of animals that talk and discover that this great land this from ago many years under the reign of a wicked witch that is under a winter that never ends and therefore can not get Christmas, also discover that they are the protagonists of a prophecy that says that they will be the saviours of Narnia and all its inhabitants and that they must lead a battle together Aslan, a powerful lion, the Witch and his followers.Fantasy came to this Christmas, first it was Harry Potter, now Disney brings us to Narnia and there is king Kong. I went to see this movie yesterday and I liked enough, although I sometimes thought it was a little slow and the other a little child has some scenes that are spectacular as the battle but in general her can enjoy both large and small.This film directly competes against Harry Potter, I think that it is aimed at the same kind of public, but between the two I think that Harry Potter is the most fun and entertaining.The Chronicles of Narnia lacked something (don't know what Express) to become a classic family or Christmas. It is an excellent film, I recommend to all, my favorite scene was the battle, it is spectacular, with amazing effects. It is a very good movie to see it in family and in this Christmas, it has that perfect Christmas air for these festivities.</body>
