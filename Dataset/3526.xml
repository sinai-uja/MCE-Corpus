His ex-wife still trusts him and convinces her boyfriend, the most powerful Hollywood producer that leave direct a film to create secure success. All starts well but soon director suffers psychosomatic blindness, by what you can that will have help someone who is their eyes. "Everything will of course, be a chaos". Excessively irregular comedy genius Allen. Arguably, it has two distinct parts. The first is agile, very funny, with clever dialogues, full of puns. The comical is high and love. However, it is not known why, suddenly falls rhythm and everything becomes quite dull, with something tedious moments, which is unforgivable in a comedy self-respecting. Its final, despite having Coif seafaring with the subject of French critics, it is too fast and easy, as if Mr. Allen wanted to suddenly end with the realization.Finally, a small step back, although aunque debe must be because Woody Allen, even though it is not 100 per cent, offers more movies in average film than most of his contemporaries in his entire career.</body>
