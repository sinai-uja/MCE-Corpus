	<body>"Three most dangerous gangs join to steal all the jewelry of a peaceful and prosperous people." In fact, they achieve their purpose, after killing some people and cause great damage. The police don't know where hiding, though they know that the head is remote somewhere in the jungle. "But a shrewd police inspector follows them and is gradually capturing several members of the band that carried them the rest."Mediocre Thai action desenfrendada film, with what the exoticism is served, along with the lack of rigor. Everything is excessive, from violence, to performances, except in two or three cases. The tape could have been indigesta, but his lack of great pretensions and a desire to lùdico inherent in any time in history, manage, ultimately to be something nice. No good, no, but it is funny at some point and, surprisingly, entretenidilla. Cast bells on-the-fly, because everything is quite seen but not bored.Best thing is the photo which highlights the impressive landscapes where with these beautiful jungles, the film is shot with their streams and so. And also the character of the head of the band, a kind of zany Demi-God of evil, almost indestructible. The truth is that it is not anything good, but can be seen.</body>
