	<summary>New torture and new aparatejos, complicated and repulsive at the same time with the scoop to meet first hand the authentic workshop of creation of puzzle.</summary>
	<body>In the same line as the previous ones, this 3rd part of the series, which began as a revelation of the genre of psychological terror, now discover us a possible end for some, and a window on another new sequel for others.Again puzzle shows us the side more psychopath of his mind, this time more predictable than previously, although until the end does not reveal its true intention.Perhaps this installment is the weaker of the three, but not why it free of extreme moments in the purest style saw and touching as not that point gore who has served as inspiration to other titles such as Hostel (which incidentally released soon its 2nd part).Ay recognize that strong point, met it with the first installment and to overcome that feeling after seeing the movie, it was very difficult. I Saw has marked a way of doing a mass product, a product that is sold and bought with a success which could not be repeated if a 4th sequel of al gore.If you liked the previous ones, going to leave happy to see this film, but not surprised. The valuation in general is good but not excellent as it was the case in the first film. The actors are very but very credible and scenarios are very curious. New torture and new aparatejos, complicated and repulsive at the same time with the scoop to meet first hand the authentic workshop of creation of puzzle.</body>
