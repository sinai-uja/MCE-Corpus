	<summary>A tape as weak and irrelevant, that will make you yawning while you slept 15 hours</summary>
	<body>Inconsequential infantiloide film that covered in the purest "moralina Disney" trying to add "super-hero" tapes, and is the film recalls, among other a: "The fantastic four", "X-Men", "Sky High" and even "The Incredibles" of Pixar.Es a shame that a few showy decorations have been accompanied by some special effects (more than anything CGI) quite simplistic, on the other hand, the originality of the script falls under its own weight, (or perhaps is that everything is already created), even the ridiculous names of superheroes that form this group ZP (do Tengrá something to do with the film President? hehe).The characters seem to made thinking in merchandising, a sale of dolls, mugs, t-shirts, etc. I'm sorry by Tim Allen, but a type which I fell well, starts result me weary tapes like these, accompanied once more of Spencer Breslin, who seems that it likes to do over and over again the same role; by the way, I discovered Kate Mara that I liked much more than the rest of the casting, a pity that Chevy Chase has returned to the cinema with this film, by the way Courtney Cox is has operated chest?Finally, tape as weak and irrelevant, it will make you yawning while you slept 15 hours.</body>
