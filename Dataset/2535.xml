	<body>Every summer we get a tape of animation that will be that "highlight" on screen, this, also undertaken by computer, as it is still normal, however drinking sources more classics of it, such as the "Cartoon" of Tex Avery along with the more conventional animation.A comedy for the whole family, with quite a few jokes and enough humor "blow and with one blow" that starts the p√°tio seats more of one sonorous laugh, however the film becomes very short (hour and a quarter in opening credits included) and the feeling that the script leaves things in the pipeline is the note dominant in the audience once the projection.I was interested to see the dubbing of the "time famosetes" do again "Madagascar" but as I have seen in you can not judge. Wait for the DVD to do so.A movie that will most like the kids of the House that the elderly, who are a tad saturated this kind of stories.</body>
