	<summary>A healthy entertainment for the whole family, the truth is that it does not discover anything new that has not been on TV, but is that not what sought. Long fun with the Simpsons.</summary>
	<body>Fun long based on the already long and successful television series of cartoons with Simpsons stars.Here, with a duration of three chapters and a half, he follows with his misadventures, taking them to them as the main and almost almost unique character.Therefore, if someone had not seen, impossible thing, a chapter of the series, would the same because I could perfectly understand the idiosyncrasies of the characters, since, say side, just they have an important part. Know nothing of them difficult not one iota the understanding of history.A story with plot of clear ecological dye, which serves to give puyazos to almost everything that moves: the Government, its politicians, religion, sex, ecology. everything is touched and sometimes sunk in a very entertaining movie, like his great pace and their funny and successful dialogue.A healthy entertainment for the whole family, the truth is that it does not discover anything new that has not been on TV, but is that not what sought. If it would have been the case, be original, have obviously not achieved. But passes it one good seeing it.</body>
