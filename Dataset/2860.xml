	<summary>Cinema bizarre exercise to the Hitchcock that ends up being a circus spectacle of boring acrobats who end up despanzurrando on the floor.  And I am...</summary>
	<body>The viewer little picky are you anesthesia the sudden interest in good cinema with products of this species: invoiced films under the always helpings resource go being misled, adding false leads that tripping over themselves viewing to a tour de force pathetic with the inevitable slogan of "Let's see who is capable of filming an engañabobos with finest ingredients". Because seducing a stranger is an elegant scam, not dumbs the casual viewer, but that outraged to who still takes pleasure in the misty atmosphere of the classics of the genre, worthy and imperishable, written with respect for the intelligence of who sacrifices a couple of hours of your time to lose in a deranged carousel of computer goodies, forensic camelos and rattling sounds end to disarm the weak will that something of what we have just suffer canover time, bring us some beautiful memories. Anyway, all this film seeks and makes life bonancible and jubilant. We agree that tens (read if you want to hundreds) worst films, but the mimbres of this, its cast - as I said before - and dreadful machinery of marketing that sprayed it the world deserved a level certainly higher. We are asking for mediocrity and find mediocrity. Or perhaps comes to happen to see that James Foley directs the play, we believe that we have the right to find something of what we saw, and we enjoyed enormously, in his film Glengarry Glenn Ross, master piece of recent American cinema in view of this (now) stunning chronicler.The popularity of its actors (Berry, Willis) does not guarantee anything: in any case it aggravates. I'm going to write it well clear: a terrible film. Luckily that I rented it in a video store.</body>
