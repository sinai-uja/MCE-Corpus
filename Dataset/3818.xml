	<body>Do not think to roll me the slightest to comment on a film which is a photocopy of the search of about three years ago. Neither better nor worse simply more of the same to try to repeat the success that especially the protagonist NICOLAS CAGE after failures of the caliber of NEXT, the Remake of the WICKER MAN needs urgently to succeed at the box office to keep his star status.Repeats the same cast with contributions from ED HARRIS "goodbye little goodbye" or the escarizada by the Queen HELEN MIRREN in food roles to keep their accounts in high.Repeats the director returns to manage effectively the loose budget to provide an effective entertainment and little more.All the technical effects are of the highest level not in vain the producer is the Almighty JERRY BRUCKHEIMER is currently the Messiah of entertainment with sagas so productive as pirates of the Caribbean.</body>
