	<body>With great enthusiasm we had to see this movie, my half Zucchini and me. The pirates always are interesting, that guarantee you good espadazos and naval battles (matches the pirates porn movies are nabales, ji, ji, ji), as well as interesting arguments on treasures of incalculable value. The only thing that I mosqueaba much is not having heard talk about this film in life, but no one will know more than the imdb.The film is about a pirate of pata de palo and his faithful squire, a little charlatan but effective kid. It turns out that he is the famous pirate network, which was given by dead years ago and it now returns. On his way, he meets a throne of Aztec gold, which makes him obsessed with him and pursue him to the ends of the universe (more or less).As I read out there, Roman Polanski took 10 years to make this film, given that no producer was wanted catch. They predicted a tremendous commercial failure of the same, as it was. And no wonder. One when he sees one of the pirates expected something very different to what is this film. The thing is made with a sense of humor, with quite sympathetic scenes (blows and things as well), but for the part epic, is far from a good thing. The argument is very strange with a lame pirate fat and prone to cannibalism which makes patochadas everywhere. No, I do not like the experiments here, we need a bad-tempered, sober and heartless pirate. Then the issue of the soundtrack, not paste anything with the movies of the genre nor liked.In short, strange experiment of film of hackers who at that time was a commercial failure with good reason. Only saves the performance of Walter Matthau, which has great moments.</body>
