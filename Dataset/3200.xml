	<summary>Here be very clear what balls wants every one, without going into the issue of sexuality, so last of mother as a "Balance of" Palma does not end.</summary>
	<body>Kenneth Branagh signed one of the experiments of the rarest of the season with his version (with the permission of Harold Pinter) of Anthony Shaffer which had already led to the film in an impeccable way Joseph l. Mankiewicz makes thirty and five añazos with bad luck to coincide with the Godfather the Academia.Ahora ceremony occurs in most twisted waymore visceral, visually impeccable for forty minutes (the composition feel me great at times) and with a script more or less "equal" until that gets it out of hand, and that way, in the other forty-five. Correct, it lasts three quarters of an hour less than the previous and I appreciate the Director because the thing could have ended up in Stampede.Michael Caine gives bad baba her ex - nemesis of almost four decades ago and Jude Law becomes at the end in a sort of Jim Carrey English with echoes jockerísticos him ahead of pearls for the writer of the next Scary Movie. If in the original we had two characters with two completely opposite objectives and a game of cat and mouse delusional and malevolent, here does not end be very clear what balls wants every one, without going into the issue of sexuality, so last of mother as a De Palma "In balance".An exercise much more risky than the Rob Zombie Halloween but equally unnecessary.</body>
