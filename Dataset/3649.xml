	<summary>More beyond the dense subject of an illegal abortion and all that it entails, the Romanian film does not stop there (luckily). It contributes decisively Anamaria Marinca's performance.</summary>
	<body>A new emerging cinema as the Romanian is delighting that indiscreet Viewer, that seeks to discover new languages, new stories, new societies. So far a film seen only in festivals, that little by little gaining ground distribution circuit. Cristian Mungiu film is, above all things, an ode to friendship. The director is live. The story in real time, without just music, claustrophobic and spaces, occasionally with camera in hand &hellip; all willing to tell us a raw story without concessions, without eyes moralist. The history of a clandestine abortion serves to make a portrait of a moment of transition, a marginal view of a post-Soviet country.Beyond of the dense subject of an illegal abortion and all that it entails, the Romanian film doesn't stop there (luckily). And, in this way, it becomes one of the best films of the year, winner of the Palme d'Or at the last edition of the Cannes Festival. It contributes decisively Anamaria Marinca's performance. A prodigy full of candor in a context so cold. His gaze is synonymous with hope. Their gestures denotes complicity. The film wouldn't exist without Marinca. His character the epicenter in a world in which everyone trying to survive. Without area. No time and decisions cannot wait. In a world on the verge of collapse have no more than running.Run in a room of a hotel in fourth. Run on dark streets without transit only. Run up to the top floor of a building in ruins. Run without escape. Run to overcome a commitment. Only friendship. The bond between the two, that way of understanding life. The umbilical cord that gives life, the only hope. Again, the look of Otilia. of Marinca.</body>
