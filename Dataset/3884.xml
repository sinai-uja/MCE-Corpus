	<body>Noah and Emma are two brothers who one day found a box on the beach while on vacation. Inside the box are hidden foreign objects and a stuffed rabbit named Mimzy which soon become inseparable for Emma. Little by little children are discovered and used the box things will develop an intelligence out of the ordinary that will make them to discover the real reason and the use of the mysterious box and its components.Modest film that clearly seeks to entertain without many more claims that at least achieves its purpose. On the basis of an interesting plot, based on a short story written in 1943 by Lewis Padgett, the film takes clearly as a basis the great classic e. T. The alien, if even the boy protagonist is just going all day with the same jersey with CAP, and it develops under the same scheme. But the tape is playing its cards and introducing the mysteries of quite correctly and able to maintain attention on it during your footage, which is already more than what they have done many other fantastic tapes designed to the public child last year.Anyway be made in more lack of depth especially once discovered that is in reality the Teddy, have entered more the subject of science, who plays very on tiptoe. No longer a movie aimed at children anyway, everything is quite simple and easily digestible. The special effects are quite discrete, but are always based on the film and not as mere adornment.Mymzy is something more entertaining and correct what we usually find in this type of production, a funny and enjoyable film that perfectly meets the expectations.</body>
