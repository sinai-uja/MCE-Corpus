	<summary>Much sugar and little smile. Only for teenagers or for those who have been in New York.</summary>
	<body>Delighted, it's a movie of Disney that tells the story of Princess Giselle, expelled from their magical land and musical to the harsh reality of the streets of Manhattan.Es a movie that doesn't fool. In my opinion, the sector that most can enjoy it is ranging from 10 to 14 years. And I dare say that it is not for those who also like adults, since that forms are pure teens.Even to someone like me, able to withstand high doses of cake in the movies, this is me indigestó without remedy with a message too sweet, although worthy of praise: the illusion for the ideal love, or almost.Does the comic part of this romantic film, almost no gag, getting just any smile aislada.¿Por what went to see her didn't me then? For a misleading comment of a radio station, and because a couple of months ago I was in New York, and for me, only to see the kiosk in Columbus Circle where ate breakfast or the sequence of Central Park, makes it worthwhile.Conclusion: If you have a tontorrón day (but long), or you have 13 years, or you've been in New York, you can have a nice time. If you can not, you save without problems</body>
