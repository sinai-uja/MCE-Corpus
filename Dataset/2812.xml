	<body>Endless tears fell on my face last night watching this jewel of the gore of Z series. A group of hippies worshipers of Satan reaches of abandoned quasi pueblucho hundred by hundred Yankee where they violate and hit a girl and become a House squatters. (Small, fat, clumsy and small) brother of the girl offered then a few cakes of meat infected with rabies (blood you brought to a dead rabid dog) and Mount of God. Full of hilarious details, like friendship and subsequent romance of the initial one of his attackers victim (that most nice girl, it forgives everything, even the violation), or some currelas pulling machete with rabies blood infected by have been brushed all to the same bitch hippie. White caimans and music garage-surf to the attacks, a masterpiece full of situations hilarious almost all by the fucking boy, especially when "through" the door of the barn and its reaction to discovering his grandfather impale, worthy of Ed Wood himself. The truth is that it has become now a classic of those I have to teach visitors, so great that it will cost me stay with a single sentence, but I think that I have: "Forgive her, know not what you do, it is silent". Anthology. It is one of my favorites.</body>
