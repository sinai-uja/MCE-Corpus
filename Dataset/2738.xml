	<body>If I had balls to the second part of the adventures of Jason Bourne was because I caught her by surprise to have discovered shortly before its premiere the Bourne, the first of the three and the most classical case. Why the jump from the first (and great, while it may seem that no one remember it today, it seems that only the director of the boring Bloody Sunday had "approached" the absent-minded spy), great entertainment, directed by Doug Liman to the "chaos" of the second upset me a bit.But the thing is that the Bourne Ultimatum is an entretenidísimo and fast-paced tour de force, a frantic flight and persecution does not give respite to the spectator, which assimilates already better that the camera causes Cassius Clay.Efectivamente and reads the poster, Matt Damon is Jason Bourne, the work of the actor as fantastic as well as that of the rest of the castin particular David Strathairn and Joan Allen.El final (of the film and the box office) can ensure the continuation of the saga, but the continuity of Jason Bourne?. If this is a spoiler or you must not find out paying the entry. It is worth the trouble.</body>
