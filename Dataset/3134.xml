	<body>On Saturday, while it was time to go to an unfortunate family event, I found this film four put media later and where we had to Whoopy Goldberg (by this woman do not pass the years) and Haley Joel Osment (the famous child of "The sixth sense") when it was peque√±ajo, as well as Gerard Depardieu in her American stage (short-lived)(to tell the truth, because is he has not seen by Hollywood).There was talking to imaginary beings in the award-winning and legendary "Ghost" to save any other parallelism between the histrionics of the Goldberg and the candor of Osment and Depardieu, that unfortunately and after taking us almost 2 hours with the soul in suspense advocates toward a happy End already Norman Jewison composed here a tape, dramatic half, half fantastic on the original imagination of the character of Osment, that while it is true Whoopy too elducorada (and sweetener).Osment, with just 5 years already he saw ways and even true talent could guess, and is, no mistake, because with permission of Dakota Fanning, and some that another "whippersnapper" kids more, is one of the best-known children's faces in the last decade.In short, typical feature of desktop, does not bother in viewing, but that after its predictable argument overlooked with the same ease that is digested, go, fast consumption and little more.</body>
