What is sure is that its about forged a legend and myth, that have survived to our days.The film has led on many occasions the life of Jesse James to the big screen, so Andrew Dominik decided to give the story a new approach, distancing themselves from the best-known facet of James and focusing on his last months of life. It does not through the eyes of the mythical Bushranger, but that you do from the perspective of the man that ended with the legend. Based on the novel by Ron Hansen, the assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is an approach to the man that was behind the myth, showing his more human side, but also their miseries and turn dark and tormented.
