	<body>In 1987, with only 11 years old of age, I faced for the first time to go to the movies out of my neighborhood (Aluche), we had to beg, and almost get on his knees so both a teammate of my then class as me, leave us one rainy Saturday afternoon, attend a cinema in the Centre of Madrid (now-extinct Madrid cinema) (no adult) to see the first ninja turtles film, or saying that you being a tender infante, the tape shocked me, and got those animals green, with whom shared name (well, with one of them), formed along with other tapes a part of my childhood, these great marionestas created by the late Jim Henson.Hoy, 20 years after the first "tortugil" Premiere, we turn to see the facesThis time the TMNT CGI, are made so beautiful with last generation computers, showing both the hairs of the rat Splinter (endearing character ever there), as the skin of turtles in a really surprising way, shame that humans who appear in the film are not so well achieved, since they seem simpler characters in comicthat people real; then pointing the first both negative to this revisitación of a myth of the childhood of many thirtysomethings, among whom I am.Logically, and to 20 years ago, the tape is aimed at children, is why it lacks of violence (and that promised otherwise) and his humor sometimes becomes quite shabby, but there are somewhat confusing moments that will leave the munchkins with poker face. Of course one has to raise in advance with what you see, and without have a fairly broad critical spirit, give a few small drops of confidence to what we see on screen, go, leaving the brain in off, without asking too many questions.On the other hand, the set of voices in V.O. is more diverse, featuring, among others, Sarah Michelle Gellar as April, Chris Evans as Casey Jones, the Eastern actor Zang Ziyi as Splinter, as well as the "mutant" Patrick Stewart, as the villain role and initial tape Narrator; in its Spanish version the usual actors voices will be respected so that we won't have to endure any stupid "question famosillo" putting voice to any animated character.Something that I not come to convince too is abuse of flat air and rooftops, over and over again (repetitive, by Jove!) and that he intends to turn its hue but more comiquera, we should not forget that the turtles were first comic before its passage to celluloid.On the other hand, found it me particularly significant, the introduction/presentation of the main characters (Leonardo, Donatello, Miguelangelo and Raphael.), as well as the clarity of movements in the fight scenes, clearer, for example in "Spiderman 3" where it was impossible to know who did what.Its Score, composed by the already famous musician, Klaus Badelt (author of the fanfare of "Pirates of the Caribbean"), composed a careful selection of cuts heróicos, accompanying the development of the action you see on screen, giving a sound elegant and at the same time perfect in his aplitud way soverbia.In USA it has worked quite well at the box office, being the most-watched tape for 1 week and staying for 3 weeks in the top 10 most-watched tapes, grossing so far, insignificant nothing figure of the green currency (dollar) 53.000.000. do for what almost always animation and child go hand in hand? More than once I had to say without shame that, even at my age, I still like the films of "Drawings".</body>
