	<body>Another movie that happens to clog up the list of movies that do not have more nothing. Slow pace and few resources for a simple story in which Goya (Stellan Skarsgard, Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3) is represented as a simple gueb√≥n with Bardem get better interpretations of this film, absolutely boring and tedious. Bardem, works the voice please, lately you always hear the same key for all the characters, big mistake.Come with my beloved Natalie, I cannot be objective with it, I can be her beauty, is that although does not say anything to my I love his eyes and distracts me completely, even I can say that unfortunately it is not the best that has been done, is much better in V for Vendetta. Here it passes without penalty or glory. Feel me pathetic double interpretation mother/daughter, but that is blame Milos Forman clear.Amazingly poorly directed, say surprisingly because I have to Milos for a great director and I do not understand this slump of the director. To highlight the costume, the soundtrack gives headache. The title of the film does not refer to what was then shown, is more one story of unrequited love more than anything else. I thought I would show more interior painter hell, but not? the is simply one pawn.</body>
