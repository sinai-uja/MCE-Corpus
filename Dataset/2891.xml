	<body>It is difficult to see a film noir story well told and with good doses of suspense today. And without a doubt, Paul McGuigan with his film "The case Slevin" succeeds.The film tells the story of a young man named Slevin (whose role plays, without too much conviction for my taste, Josh Harnett) is confused with a friend of his to reach the city and enters the game of two warring gangsters: the Rabbi (masterfully played by Ben Kingsley) and head (Morgan Freeman). The shadow of a gunman called Goodkat (Bruce Willis) with some whose intentions are nothing clear plans to throughout the film.In the film are mixed action sequences, with the suspense and small dressings of humor. I liked the direction of the film in which the director mixes long sequences with some very short that leave the viewer with a "puzzle" front as well. Also, the flashback at the beginning, getting us in situation. That is one of those movies in which we must not lose nor an only time, not an only detail as the to "fit" the pieces depends on this.The movie reminded me several times to others of the same genre as "Usual suspects" or "Snatch: pigs and diamonds". However, the final fabric is somewhat confusing and it is the feeling that the director and the writer have "cheated us" because there are details that do not fit us.</body>
