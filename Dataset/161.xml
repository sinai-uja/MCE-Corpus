	<body>Return is a return to the brighter past by Pedro Almodóvar. A past in which the tragedy was mixed with the comic in a natural way and without stridency. In the new film by Almodovar, Penélope Cruz has reason to ask: "what I have done to deserve this?" (1984), great work from the November manchego director which bears many similarities with "Volver". As in the previous film, the death has become charged role in this new film as well as the figure of off-road women you should know to engage in embarrassing situations.Return is an immersion into the female of the peoples of Spain universe, a rural setting where human relations are deeper and become more important secrets and complicity with regard to interpretations, surprised a Penelope Cruz arriving moved on and we must not underestimate the quality of Blanca Portillo (very contained, unlike its role in 7 vidas) and Lola Dueñas. The character of Carmen Maura, on the other hand, provides the comic point in the film.But perhaps the greater success of Almodóvar in this film is part of the freshness and originality of his script, the accurate combination between the tragic and the comic, because the film Almodóvar intended to be a reflection of life, a life as anyone that intertwine the most harmful moments with others more comedians or even that they reach the absurd.</body>
