	<body>Said Alex of the Anglican (its director) in one of the multitudinous interviews granted on the occasion of the premiere of the film, which had distanced himself a bit of commercial cinema because he did not want to go asking permission always producers to make "his" film, am sorry to say, Mr of the Church that if there is a film of his career to bitto say nothing, have to do with it is this that today brings us, where we see or phlegm geek that often accompany him, nor the bad baba of many of his scripts, or that air distracted and sometimes maquiavelicamente illustrated their previous tape; Moreover, and returning to his words I would say that while he categorically stated that he didn't want to make a film in Hollywood of test, I would say that perhaps, and surreptitiously this was (along with the bizarre "Perdita Durango") the best letter of presentation of the Basque director towards the Anglo-Saxon market perhaps should believe us that a tape with Elijah Wood and John Hurt (which in Spain have given by baptize as "Elijah")?Leonor Watling, Julie Cox, Burn Gorman, Anna Massey and Jim Carter among others. You will only see in our country? Leaving aside that this is perhaps the most impersonal tape of the Church (only the bizarre character of Alex Cox is part of this monstrous visual imagery of the Basque director), are faced with a great movie.From the beginning one intuits that is before something big with this excellent level sequence where we can see the characters, the best I've seen in movies much, long, in addition to the dialogues; I had read for why this tape was lost in dialogue impossible, however for my all that verbiage mathematical isn't over a tape where the mystery is in the theorems and other formulas and says it someone is not very versed in theorems and always 2 + 2 is equal to 5. the setting of Oxford, the University City, the Salamanca of England is one character again, with their large roofs, their students from here to there and the racking, frantic quasi of the great Anglo-Saxon towns.Of the actors, I'll take both Hurt (overflows on screen just appear), as Elijah that not can stand out from his role as Frodo Baggins in no time as well as sexy Leonor Watling that. In short, impossible to express in words what that woman transmits with her eyes and her body (and some part of her upper Anatomy), apologize in advance for comment so unfortunate to feminists who I read.Is true that the final resolution (and with this term) is somewhat dodgier, but ultimately we have a Mystery Thriller and always, or almost always, the culprit is who is less imagine, and much more stupid resolution of what our heads could devise.In short, an excellent work of Alex de La Iglesia, outside their usual environment.</body>
