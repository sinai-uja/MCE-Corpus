	<body>Second film of voyeurs that I see this week and antithesis alone with her, Disturbia is the blockbuster that will come to our screens for September or October neither more nor less.Genuine crack-ta-ta-lockers in the United States is a fun teen thriller that works a charm because Carl Ellsworth and Christopher B. Landon, the writers are very clever guys.They have borrowed the Decade of the eighties (and are already.), specifically night of fear, A cool gang and the neighborhood of Tom Hanks to make one of those clip shows go thou to know why, works.Transformers was the confirmation of the talent of Shia LaBeouf, great here also Corey Feldman. The start of the movie is giant and already you can not takeoff.One of those rare occasions where it is rewarding to review the past. With regard to the enormous delay in the premieres of some feature films (in particular the latest Coen) today in the country read Diego Galán quoting Mr. Belvedere: in full 2007, any downtime is a clear invitation to theft.</body>
