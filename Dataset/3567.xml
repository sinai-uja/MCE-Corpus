	<summary>A surprise at the moment has no release date at Spain.</summary>
	<body>As with "Paris Je't Aime", or the more recent "Manuale De Amore" (1 and 2), now in "The Ten" We also find a film based on short stories, I like the idea of parody every commandment and post to it would have a parody quite logic, I like how the writers have broken the head in, with all the characters, weaving them together, to achieve as well as comic situations, all together in the film.It is true that some stories are made well and others seem to be more, on the other hand, is normal in this type of movies where everything as I have already said, sometimes requires more, than less.On the other hand, the cast, headed by Jessica Alba, Winona Ryder (this girl has always had these Pectoral?), Gretchen Mol, Famke Janssen, Oliver Platt and Liev Schreiber, Justin Theroux, bring this packaging the protagonists need, with special attention to the 2 musical numbers at the end, where all the protagonists appear singing as "better you know do it".A surprise at the moment has no release date at Spain.</body>
