	<summary>Interesting proposal for all fans to this genus, which they like escape and amaze with the sniping skills.</summary>
	<body>Mark Wahlberg is presented as the star of the film, and I must say, it plays more than his role.After his recent Oscar by "Infiltrators", the protagonist of "Boogie Nights" embodies a sniper of the United States, who, after being away from the military world, is recruited as an Advisor on a mission. What he does not expect, is that they tend a trap, which is why the rest of the film will try to prove his innocence, and enforce the (his) justice. To this end it has Michael Pe√±a, who co-starred in "World Trade Center", and Kate Mara as allies.In every action movie, always has to be a bad thing, and in "Shooter: the shooter" this role embodies it Danny Glover.Basada in the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, the new work of Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day") is presented as an interesting action film, in which the story takes place irregularly, in a script that could have given more than itself, but despite that makes us get involved in the crusade of Bob Lee Swagger (Wahlberg), all this sprinkled with large scenes where the smoke, fire, bullets and even Napalm, have his appearance.Therefore, "Shooter: the shooter", is presented as an interesting proposal for all fans to this genus, which they like escape and amaze with the sniping skills.</body>
