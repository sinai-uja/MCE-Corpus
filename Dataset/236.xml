	<summary>Roll wrapped in an aura of absurd controversy</summary>
	<body>That mess there is in the current film. The other day we see magneto there fighting with Wolverine and company and it is that it is no longer evil now to become a historian. And looking for the Holy Grail, no less. This man is amazing, that desire to live that has. At least removed layer that so cumbersome that Lucia, it is appreciated. Incidentally, the subtle poster, covering him la boquita to the Mona Lisa (who say that mona was mono). I like the poster.The film is a type who is killed in the Louvre Museum by an albino monk. As he not only died, but decides to write a message with his own blood so they discover the murderer, it reaches the scene Robert Langdon. A Mr historian who like decrypting secret and similar codes. So that helped with the granddaughter of the historian and persecuted by the French police, and the albino monk begins the search for the Holy Grail. It does not look bad.Well, before anything, read the book before seeing a movie does say in all cases "was better the book". Which as you may know. As film not liked much. It seems very hasty, with very fast sequences and stoppages play too long. It explains much about history, but does not end fit. In the end we go to movies to entertain us, not to learn. The action scenes are many and are not good. The plot is something incredible, given that the Holy Grail was hidden and within two hours of centuries and film media the Lord this finds, taking the colors turn to the Opus and the French police. And all as wanting to tell us that this is feasible. It is not very credible, not. In addition, Tom Hanks not killing me, so I'm going to deceive you.In short, suavecita film for a silly evening of these heat you aplatana and entering you take refuge in the film. Good NAP can take, of course.</body>
