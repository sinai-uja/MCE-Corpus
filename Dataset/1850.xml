	<body>The female breasts are a mystery of mankind. Do as they may be flabby and without healthiness and a textile such as the corset or the wonderbrá element become a constant challenge to the laws of gravity? Why is not there a male version to be able to show off Zucchini garden between the legs? I say that both protagonists look tits that not one hundred carts, valgame Dios.La film is about two young ladies at the time of the development of the railway in Mexico. One of the high class, another possible most humble class. By accidents of fate, they are forced to work together robbing banks which makes them a few heroines in his country championing a small revolution against the power which seeks to establish the United States. Or more or less trafficking of that, right?Hey, look who was thinking of I that this was going to be an infumable truño and was not so bad. It is a peliculilla of very ligerita action with a very predictable script smoothly, but leaves good taste. It has its humor, its scenes picantonas momentitos, but fails to throw you in any moment of it. For being so light, it lets you follow the film easily, so you can be in the cinema thinking about your stuff that you finally hear everything. The atmosphere is rather curious and actors do very well, and see that Penelope is not of my devotion. By the way, I spent the entire film trying to decrypting of who was the voice of the voice of the villain, and I think that it is one of Cars, does anyone know who is?In short, comedieta action light and cool to take the afternoon and go out with a sonrisilla of good vibes.</body>
