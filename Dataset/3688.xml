	<summary>With both firework in the fantastic films of today, are grateful pearls returning to the essence that never had missed: fantasy, adventure, magic, love.</summary>
	<body>Stardust is a fantastic film to use, with princes, Star rather than Princess, pirates, witches and many magic.Few buts I get. Perhaps the male protagonist, in line with the new guapitos heroes, but very little thing. The story, still with many secondary elements to get game, draw something ungainly at times. But. little more, because it is well done. Full of excellent characters of distribution (such as the pirate played by Robert De Niro) are adding to a movie that's alone works almost without remedy.You are going to more, with hisses without end, romantic where there and of course. happy.A film which strangely had no advertising and the echo it certainly deserves. If you can, look her where even her exhibited and not miss.</body>
