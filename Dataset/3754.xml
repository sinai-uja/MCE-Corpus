	<summary>On many occasions, the second parts were never good, but sometimes you have to try to see that it comes...</summary>
	<body>On this occasion, the opportunity is worthwhile, especially for those who enjoy the fun adventures that left us the first part of the search. And that which has all the topical ingredients of a film of this genre: ironic prota with dowries of hero, half dumb desired woman to which the ironic prota needs your help, secondary bad fun with clever phrases, and it seems bad until the end makes nonsense that lets you be bad.In any case, this new product from la factoria Bruckheimer, do not lose the hook in the first, you embarcas from the outset with Nicolas Cage in each one of the tracks and are impatient for that to arrive the following. It retains the good humor and good relations between the different characters, which joins a brilliant Helen Mirren.Y also me continues to surprise the large capacity to unite stories that have really happened with the search for amazing treasures, without that seems an unlikely thing, denoting a great work of documentation, which comes from pearls to the history.Espremos that if you reach a third search, not decay tone and good humor and continue entertaining people that we like to escape from the noise with films that entertain us and make us have a good time.</body>
