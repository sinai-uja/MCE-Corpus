	<body>By God, who has combed so to Pierce Brosman? With the Pura and those sideburns. Not to mention the clothes. My mother cutrez you have given to this actor who came to make James Bond. With a poster, with painted things to boli not can be very far, not.The film is a Hitman who soon Gets a job in Mexico and for this reason is known to a businessman who is about to close good business. For various reasons, it has to work killing people that others close business. And for designs of fate, their lives are uniting at times during the hour and a half of the film. I think it is the most crappy summary I have ever done.This has been one of the few times that I have started to tell what is the film and I've been blank, given that it is very complex to explain it without her whole. And is that when it was already half an hour I thought "if still not be that will". And indeed, we have a film which has an introduction by almost an hour, a plot of 20 minutes and the final ten. And that crashes. On the other hand, the story is that it does not give much, because it has no subtramas or similar. A very linear story, whose single grace is that they have given cuts the Ribbon to keep the interest of the public about a particular moment. On the positive side, the tape has quite a few funny points, which are given either by absurd situations or clotted expressions of the protagonist. Pierce Brosman makes a very good role, saving to a large extent this slightly mediocre movie.In short, a curiosity that will not go to the annals of the history of the cinema, and possibly you delete the head as soon as you leave the room.</body>
