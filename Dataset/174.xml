	<summary>A production made to make Tom Cruise look from start to finish</summary>
	<body>Yes already saw the first two parts of this (now) mission impossible trilogy, because you can tell that you saw the third and final (for now). More of the same, which is not to say that it is bad.Of course is not a film to think much, but made production to make Tom Cruise look from start to finish, as the almost famous agent of the IMF (International Monetary Fund, not force mission impossible), Ethan Hunt.Cabe say that in the first mission impossible (1996, just a decade ago) pataleé crazy because they destroyed the sense of the television seriesone of my favorites, making that the leader of the group, Jim Phelps turned out to be a traitor. The grace of the series was the teamwork and loyalty to bulletproof between this "family" of agents. But in the film version, this has just been and Tom remains same James Bond, ready for several sequels and several million.Do you like full adrenaline productions, where burst bombs and luxurious cars like pop corn, as well as see exotic locations, this is your movie. Of course the protagonist can fall twenty times a 50 story building and never suffer nor half arañón, but just one as a spectator continues the game and eaten nails. Total for that it paid entry.Interesting the participation of the now acclaimed Philip Seymour Hoffman (who won an Oscar for best actor in Capote, 2005) as the villain. For more viewers, another plus of the film may be the participation of Keri Russell (Felicity), as another agent of the IMF.</body>
