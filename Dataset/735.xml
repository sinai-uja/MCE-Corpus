	<body>Vampires without teeth?. without teeth and with very little common sense. A group of vampires that is dedicated to go in an autocarabana by the desert and sunny spots in South America, drinking the blood of dirty bars road, and rough and hairy truckers waitresses. There is not I the biggest fan of Ann Rice and his vision romantic (and homosexual) of vampires, but, this gang of bastards curran it very little.First you fuck life poor Cowboy star of this roadmovie semi-telefilm, then go to him, and while the poor boy vomits it vomits from all corners, denying its nature it kills. normal, the only victims who put shot his comrades are young attractive dressed in tight jeans. suspicious isn't it? Well, despite everything, the movie has a huge Bill Paxton, who is shot, burned, hit, and finally disintegrated to the four winds. but its presence (and some memorable scene as that of the bar or the final duel with the own Severen) manages not far the disastrous end with transfusions of blood to discretion.In short, dear (s) reader (res), an approved that almost reaches the good for being shot before the 90, and little more.</body>
