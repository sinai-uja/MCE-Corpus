	<body>After his triumphant passage through International Festival of Sitges 2007, harvesting up to 5 awards, comes to the conventional screens the latest proposal by Homeland terror, in this case addressed to two hands by Jaume Balagueró and Paco Plaza, in an atypical history in your proposal but extremely conventional in its concept.The idea of directing a film, and as well as low budget as a whole may seem initially something strange and abnormal, but taking into account that Balagueró is a filmmaker who has shown its great values in the creation of terrifying atmosphere, with a large force in the sunset scene and the creation of moments of pure and simple horror, and Plaza is a most gifted director for the narrative progression than those moments of claw, the choice seemed completely right. Looking back on the career of Balagueró we find a series of films, that despite being irregular in its vast majority (IMHO his best film, remains his directorial debut "the nameless"), such as the failed "Darkness" or the more than interesting, but not round, "Fragile" and the tv-movie "to enter to live". For its part square offered works such as "The second name" and "Romasanta", both very significant but lacking claw narrative as I said before, proving something distant to the Viewer by the lack of adherence to the history, in the main fault of his film, which in this [REC] seems to have been solved.The story could not be more simple, accompanied by a team of reporters by your camera, and a journalist on a routine night a team of firefighters attending a building in the Centre of Barcelona, proving to be something not expected, and causing a series of events that cause a staggered more terrifying violence.During the footage, one of the strengths of the film lies in the realistic tone of the reactions of the characters, all of them are well shown in their routine daily lives, showing the reactions of all fresh and naturally before the series of events that lie ahead, something that, given that this is a film in which the creators themselves have acknowledged that they gave much freedom actors in improvidar their reactions, and even some hyperrealistic not knowing that awaited them in the filming of each scene is utterly commendable and one of the great successes of the film.On the other hand, the work after the cameras of Balagueró and Plaza only dislumbra rarely, leaving passing history in a natural way and without interference, also remarkable thing, especially when certain filmmakers strive always leave their brand while history does not require.Logically in a proposal and it would thus speak of the script be absurd because everything is limited to events that take place naturally, giving the sensation followed guidelines little slaves of a script written or at least detailed. But all this is not to say that why should there be a narrative progression, and here is where fails slightly REC, the history is a constant climax, and that does not contribute to the narrative development of history, i.e., its main virtue, it is to keep in a constant and churlish tension throughout the story, by providing it with an exacerbated realismtangible physical, and so he almost attacks the screen and the viewing part of the spectators, turns against because there comes a time in which, with the exception of the last bright 20 mínutos, the story becomes something expected, both in its history a series of scares that the Viewer already expected, although always in tension, that is undeniable.It also has a certain tone of black humor, as by the character of reporter interviews the inhabitants of the building, in which give rein to instincts as the racism towards Chinese residents, or a ruthless vision of programmes of Chronicles of events, through this immoral and arrogant reporter somewhat embodied in a remarkable manner by Manuela Velasco (not in vain)(it has exercised a similar work for television in real life).Perhaps another flaw of the film, and that if that already enters the taste of a server the classical narrative, consists of this constant movement of camera just for a little lightheaded and provoke a sense of confusion, I imagine that search.Much has been influences of another film genre which has had much impact lately, the first film of J.A.Bayona on haunted houses and spirits of ultratumba (excellent in my opinion but burdened somewhat by the clichés of the genre, as I commented in his day), but they are not less references to other films in REC, but that if, perhaps go more unnoticed, or are more tolerated by the general public because they are less popular. To start the creators themselves have acknowledged the influence (copy would say I see both proposals) a small amateur video posted on the internet, and that it is available in media as ephemeral as Youtube, on a supposed angel fallen in a rural area of our country, and this is evident in the final sequence. Other obvious influences, the second part of "Demons" by Lamberto Bava, with the zombie-infested apartment, or other various and typical references such as "The night of the living dead". Has been even the influence of that little exceptional work on the mechanisms of fear and the popular mythology that was the essential "The Blair Witch Project" (still misunderstood by many that have failed to see its symbolism), but in this case only the texture of amateur recording could find its similarity with that, while the film Myrick and Sanchez was all subtlety and pure symbolismin ECN uses the medium to create a palpable reality without excuses.In short, notable film, an orgíastico climax of violence during 80 mínutos introduces us squarely in the form of violation media in the reality of a series of characters trapped by pure terror that seizes your neighborhood, a work that with their great virtues, and in spite of slight defects, becomes a fresh and alive sample of good horror moviesAlthough it is less frightening, except its bright last 20 minutes, than it had wanted sell us in this video about reactions of staff in particular well near film festival and that so many awards granted to this film.Notable and innovative in a deconstructed industry such as the Spanish, fresh (which not original) and it represents one sample rather than the good fantasy film not attends media or budgets, but the imagination of its creators.</body>
