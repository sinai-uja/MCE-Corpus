	<body>It could pass as one of many ochenteras stronger a came between the MAD DOCTORS of all life and the slasher seen on so many occasions.The first thing that surprises is seen in the script to a stranger then BILL CONDON, one of the great authors of the time with very prominent films "KINSEY, gods and monsters". In the early 1980s he earned his life working on scripts for series b, surprise in 1987 with his first feature film as a director in the anthology SISTER SISTER. Director MICHAEL LAUGHLIN just returned to get behind the camera in a continuation of this film a couple of years later.In the cast are two outstanding performers, the winner of the oscar for someone flew over the nest of the cuckoo "LOUISE FLETCHER" and veteran MICHAEL MURPHY seen in other low-budget horror films "the House of the cliff or YORGA the Vampire". Because these non-standard substance names in the genus could not get this rarity of mediocrity. Very bad shot, performed worse, technically lacks the slightest professionalism highlighting only by a Martian plot or the costume completely Psicotronico. One of these films that despite their latent mediocrity have something special, that thug point or that such unhealthy atmosphere of 1980s. If it appreciates in dandruff fun without ask anything can be funny.</body>
