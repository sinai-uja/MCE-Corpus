	<body>Say that this sequel is better that its predecessor would tell a lot, because the truth is that it moves within the same patterns, affects the same failures and shortcomings and the only thing that improves are special, something most successful due to its greater budget effects. Despite the fact that its director Tim Story promised us that this second part was going to be much better, the truth is that had been a loose continuation of one already alone loose part.Our 4 protagonists move for invalid reasons, something that in the first part was more defined, and they militate here just to have stupid conversations with children's dialogues, Johnny Storm is still the same cool pools to before and in this sequel decides to conquer a cold soldier of the army that always gives you pumpkins until that discover that he also has its little heart, and are just falling in love with one of the many nonsense script redundant, the thing still in his shabby polispan costume and with their tantrums constant with Johnny that do not have any kind of grace already, Sue Richards makes more vase woman than anything else, and lives more worried about her wedding to save the world, you are superheroine, and eventually Reed Richards that seems to pass it better manufacturing junk and researching that you getting in bed with his wife, which is already a crime with the woman who has to this if he was concerned more save the world your wedding and is hiding from his wife, that everytime catches it investigating has a crisis of couple. A few characters who are a compendium of clichés very worn-out and boring and totally devoid of any interest.But the problem is not just that the characters are poorly defined and interpreted and flat profile, is the approach and development of the film also is plain and simple, lacks it pace and action, the family seem to a group of little than ever you get to pretend that they are able to save the world or anything by many powers that have and if add you the hair tomadura having to a Galactus in the final scene depicted as a giant hurricane, the result is much lower than expected and the feeling that, in other hands, the film would have given much more than if.I hope that if there is a third part dispatch of a director East and the team kick screenwriter and deal with the franchise anyone who knows us to give a more adult film and a better than that seen show up now, I think that the fantastic four deserve.</body>
