	<body>Pleasant surprise The Lookout, pure and simple thriller that I like much more than First snow, for example.Directs his first movie Scott Frank, who was from the scripts still die Out of sight or Minority report, three super great genre movies. My first dvd was the Soderbergh movie, do yours? "Brick" Joseph Gordon-Levitt is Chris Pratt, a kid that it had everything until an irresponsible accident cut off his wings who works washing (pasta store) Bank of the people. As a result of the accident almost so fucking go of memory as Leonard and their ability to be someone in life away to any host. Share floor and penalties with Lewis (Jeff Daniels), a man who is blind almost all life. A suspicious guy named Gary (Matthew "Watchmen" Goode) seduces him with girls, praise and money in exchange for a special collaboration. And already I do not more, although I do not think it is very difficult to know already what happens.Very entertaining and noticeably filmed is a thrill for everyone as Brick, which is trying to introduce the noir (without being especially Lookout noir despite sharing some element with the do subgenre?) in the muchachada.</body>
