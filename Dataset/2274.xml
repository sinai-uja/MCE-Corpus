	<summary>One absolute, regrettable and very bad taste waste of time... and money.</summary>
	<body>Last year was released worldwide the new project of Eli Roth, Hostel. With a budget of $ 4,500,000, the movie of Roth promoted along with the name of Quentin Tarantino (excellent business strategy) ended up grossing approximately $80.000.000 worldwide (the bait sold), still a considerable success for the director of Cabin Fever.Aquella, but passable by hairs, was nothing out of this world: its - aburridísima - first half full of tits and good women see, it was a kind of American Pie videoclipzada, more disruptive and set in the Eroupa of the East, which gave way to a funny (but not for everyone) feast on the half hour of duration of more or less explicit violence and, depending on how you look, a peculiar sense of humor.As the formula worked, and as often happens in United States, the sequel was more than assured.Because her already have here: named as Hostel, part 2, and that turns out to be for me, for now, the pior movie of the year.In Hostel, part 2 it perceives an Eli Roth desganado with a film that not fancy you. Everything is very neglected: the plot continues where left it its predecessor, making an aplaudible effort to not follow the plot clichés of the consequences of this kind of films, introducing the characters of Roger Bart and Richard Burgi to slightly boost the plot and the set end being a commercial copyasteo of the first part. In all this, it fails. Just falling into the same clichés of always, (all) characters do not stop working (badly described), and the film ends up being, as expected, a copypasteo from its predecessor. but more boring, more light and without a shred of sense of black humor breathed in Hostel, part 1 (is now there to call it?).One absolute, regrettable and very bad taste waste of time. and money.</body>
