	<summary>It is sad to be poor, but better than rico since then... A tape, which, will join all those that, like "Wall Street" and "Arms of women", will be in economy classes.</summary>
	<body>Before you begin, a little thinking that I do before starting to reel off the ins and outs of the film, for today, in this world in which we live, of wretched work and expensive mortgages, and as much as we pray and want to put a candle to S.Pancracio, is better to be poor than rich, and is having pasta, such is the development story of the tape that today brings usIt is shit, it is better to be poor and unhappy, that rich and can Feliz? With the flock of vultures there out there, waiting to get you the livers with the best of smiles.Leonardo Sbaraglia, actor who I esteem, interpret here, after an excessive narration (me bored movies where the Narrator has so many things that not little has to guess and delve into the same.), the story of an eccentric Professor of economics that winning a contest wrecks, to not keep the costs of the awards received, we see his metam√≥rfosis (excellent performance), until that gets completely crazy.On the other hand we have a staff of secondary, led by Fernando Cayo (just as bad as in the recent "the orphanage"), Chete Lera, which always makes the same role, or the tiny group of television actors of the day.I do not like his narration, mixing the agenda, trying to toggle between reality and dreams and where one he is a strange face, failing to understand that he is counting at any time of the footage; striking that hardly there are soundtrack, 2 or 3 items and stop you have.Ultimately while waiting and predictable at the outset fails to stir consciences, pity in a movie where one attempts to deepen the dangers of being rich or poor, and must enjoy, as noses, of what one has in hand.A tape, which, will join all those that, like "Wall Street" and "Arms of women", will be in economy classes, more than Keynes for another thing to mention.</body>
