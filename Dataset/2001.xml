	<body>Michael Mann's collateral nude with clarity all the vices and virtues of his filmmaker. Mounting attractive touching TV, with attractive and different textures. Realism in scenes involving bullets (remember the previous Heat) and a hyphen well built with a tendency to the excessive accumulation of dialogues. Mann simepre hits with the soundtrack and incidental music. The characters stereotyped (bad/good) that with the passage of the tape and own knowledge, reveal more similarities than differences.In his previous films, these ingredients were already included (the series Miami Vice, fire on fire, the informant, Ali), all of them in greater or lesser measure made films but in this are noticed more clearly, as if Mann did and wanted to always improve the same movie.The whole forms a product active and attractive view, with a promising start that is blurring with passage of minutes. Characters are implausible, played situations are Ditto but this if it is not a defect, the lack of logic is supplied with passion and an empathy which never comes and this Yes becomes a defect that will ruin the film.Praise to Tom Cruise in his first role "bad" are not free, but the less excessive sound. Meets without overact is not little therein but years light of their best three works: the soldier of born on the fourth of July, long-suffering Dr. Haltford's eyes well closed and the misogynistic and attractive Frank Mackey from Magnolia. Collateral in short is a film that fluctuates between indifference and sin if not what might have been. As heard passing out of the film: did me nothing.</body>
