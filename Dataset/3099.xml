	<body>Zeitgeist seems to be (and the truth is that I researched not much) a documentary made nonprofit circulating on the internet. And if you do here can see it whole (1 h 56 m) or each of its three chapters separately.While the matter begins loose, with a positivist speech anticuadísimo 'you are going to tell the truth', and the obvious follows announcing you as a tremendous revelation of 'there is no God, you're going to try' (as if it were not the easiest thing in the world to prove it, reaches that as a weapon against the faith or not), and puts all that with ochentosas images of an aestheticat least questionable, if one has patience, Zeitgeist gets fucking.The first part makes a very interesting historicization of Christianity; the second embattled the attacks on the twin towers with numerous evidence to support the hypothesis that were the same us who organized the attack, and the third and last part is which is projected towards the future, drawing conclusions (atrocious) from, among other things, of this attack and others produced in the U.S. and the global banking system.If to this end, bleak and hopeless, is compounded by the imagination of the catastrophe as a general frame of the film, the film generated a bit of paranoia, that Yes, we must grant it, not without considerable evidence.</body>
