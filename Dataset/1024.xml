	<summary>Tremendous, corny and ecosensibilizado suckling pig. Happy feet is a movie without hook and with very little personality.</summary>
	<body>Mother of God and the beautiful love that can that they are taking with the pinguinito this. And that I do not have kids if I played not, buy some mu√±equito I crappy dancer Penguin.Found me a tremendous suckling pig this film. The first time I almost sleep. Much dancing, much rattle and an argument more seen than the goals of the Malta Spain. And it is that on top of not having originality argument is repetitive, oozes moralina and smells of rotten fish. None of the scenes are saved. The songs are almost all in English and can make sense in the language of Shakespeare, but for Spanish-speakers of middle-level that they have no idea of English, the musical in this regard enhances in no time the pace of the film, or the sensitivity of the characters.If the script is bad, the design of the sets and characters nor story. The sky in many moments you notice it is drawn from a National Geographic documentary, fuck aren't even able to currar a sky? Except for the part that humans are mixed with the penguins, the rest is totally forgettable. Of the best penguins we don't talk, because they can not have chosen a more bland and monochromatic animal to make a film of nenes.Happy feet is a movie without hook and with very little personality. Despite the final blow, which makes you shudder at times, it is very painful to devote three thirds of the footage to persecutions and pinguiniles edges to give a pildorita of environmentalist message. Do not go to see her.</body>
