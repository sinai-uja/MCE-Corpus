	<body>Get to the charts seven tables of French billiards, one of the pitted in the past Film Festival of San Sebastian. In the donostiarra pageant won the awards for best screenplay and best actress for Blanca Portillo. Who knows, maybe these awards are indicators of recovery of the Spanish cinema in 2007, recovery which began with the fabulous Mataharis.No is the first time that Gracia Querejeta receives significant Awards, as his previous work, the overrated Hector, was declared as the best film of the year by the Círculo de Escritores Cinematográficos. And what things are, nor were they agreed she in the Goya. Seven French billiard tables tells the story of Angela (Maribel Verdú) and Charo (Blanca Portillo), two women who have not had luck in life. United by the pain, both decide to stand up to adversity and move forward. Gracia Querejeta signed a film that speaks of feelings, of personal relationships, ultimately of the people. The problem is it makes it through a story did not finish work, despite convey a great realism and proximity. Some of the characters and the secondary plots are not as successful, as the relationship between the characters of Raúl Arévalo and Lorraine Vindel. The tape also to spare you some minutes, although the pace of Querejeta is needing the story you want to tell.Despite its flaws, seven French billiard tables worth by the excellent interpretative duel that occurs between Maribel Verdú and Blanca Portillo. They are the best of a film full of good intentions but fails to materialize fully.</body>
