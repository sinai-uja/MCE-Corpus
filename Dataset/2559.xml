	<body>While the idea of a trip in the time always is attractive, cinematically speaking (although it has been very exploited, even has that appeal that, well made, can lead us to spend two hours quite entertaining), on this occasion we have a movie that begins in a very promising way, but that measure which is making progress in its developmentit becomes a tedious show.The director, Richard Donner, responsible for such films as "The Goonies", "Lethal weapon", "The prophecy" or "Superman" (films that once enjoyed a warm welcome among the public), offers us a tape without more significance that a well-known adaptation novel of Michael Crichton.Lo which could be a good approach (life in the 14th century, paradoxes space storms that can be created by altering some event in the past) becomes a surface productionmade for the public not stop eating popcorn and think not for two hours.We can observe as the characters and the plot itself, are diluted until you reach the limit of bland, of foreseeable (from the moment in which they appear in the 14th century, any moderately intelligent person can guess the 80 percent of the film without disheveled), with almost no interpretive depth by actors, resulting fully comedian that a group of young people without any preparation journey to the past and faced and defeated to burly officers of the English army with swords of 5 kilos, bows and other military paraphernalia. Even the siege of the Castle offers moments of action and spectacular nature, resembling props soldiers who act as if we were watching the worst episode of any B.Quitando the first ten minutes and a couple of somewhat decent dialogues, "Timeline" is a film to see and forget.</body>
