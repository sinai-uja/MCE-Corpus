	<body>The first film that directed Tommy Lee Jones is guaranteed by a script by Guillermo Arriaga. This is something we should support rather than celebrate. A screenwriter who has written the script of "loves dogs" and "21 grams" can not tell a story without adding tricks to demonstrate how knows. I recommend that they withstand the principle with the monerías of temporal disorder because then enters into flour.Tommy Lee Jones plays Pete, an American who befriends a back wet without papers called Melquiades Estrada. It is the dead of the first scene. Pete find out who killed him, plot a revenge and kidnaps him. The Viewer does not know that he wants to do with Melquiades killer and murderer nor.Most striking of this story is that the protagonist has the qualities of the bad guys in all films: has a fixed idea. While the bad happens what happens to good: has the possibility to change and learn an important lesson. This round of nut to the topics makes a special film. A film worthy of see.The only thing that is missing to be more intense, is that we knew better to MILTIADES, which cogiéramos you we just love that it takes Tommy Lee Jones. But there was no time. With so much time juggling, the writer had no time to do their job.</body>
