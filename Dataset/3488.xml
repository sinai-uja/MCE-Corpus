	<summary>Classic adventure that has not aged well.</summary>
	<body>In 1685 an English Surgeon is unjustly arrested and exiled to Jamaica. But one day manages to escape with a ship and becomes a feared pirate known as Captain Blood. "Jarcias up, monkeys!" "Plegad these candles and vedlas filling with the wind that leads towards freedom."!Film of adventures that happened as one of the best in the history of the cinema, not in vain belongs to an unrepeatable era where spectacular, fantasy, action, humor and love intermingled with unique harmony.However, and it is my view, vista nowadays, it is painful to see how has aged badly and without remedy. Yes, in its day it meant a breath of fresh air, but now remains ajada, with the pleasure of seeing acting splendid interpreters, but with the certainty that there is downtime that bedevil the pace, that we didn't see in his day, no doubt because we saw as children or youngsters. Its protagonist, at their physical peak, you gave a vitality as did it not since the days of the silent Douglas Fairbanks. But today view the tedium makes his appearance numerous times, "singing", also decorated pretty (almost all of the action is filmed in studios, something improper in a tape of Adventures).Anyway, not put in doubt who is today considered as one of the films of classical adventures that must be put as an example of good cinema, but if her postulate with considerations of when it was shot and released.</body>
