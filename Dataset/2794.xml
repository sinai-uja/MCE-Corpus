	<body>Talked to me not long ago from this film, rather then saw the trailer thanks to another blog that I've been "Oracle goer" and my opinion cannot be more satisfactory visionada once this. "Crash" is a different, as real tape as life itself and on more than one occasion leaving the viewer with their mouths open wide (as she was my case).An exceptional cast, Sandra Bullock (nothing to do with his romantic comedies), Don Cheadle, Matt Dillon, Thandie Newton, Ryan Phillippe, Brendan Fraser, Jennifer Esposito all trace interwoven stories together (in the purest style "Pulp Fiction") which, at separate first and end with one or more links of Union pounded heavily in stomach that, from a window screenyou view this unique spectacle, real, in the vast majority of cases.A film that honestly, it is worthwhile to take a look.</body>
