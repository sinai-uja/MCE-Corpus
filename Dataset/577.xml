	<body>A priori this film draws attention by its, say, new animation system (although Ralph Bakshi would have much to say about it), based first in filming the movie with real actors normally and then pass a few photoshop filters to each frame to make it look as if they were a sort of cartoon. I personally understand that this technique, in the film, only serves to disguise a seemingly important special effect in the plot, which is the use of a suit that diffuses the external appearance of the characters who want to pass unnoticed. This effect would sing much if the movie was photographed normally and with this aesthetics of animation the movie is further with an air ohh-what-cool-what-different-we are.The movie is presented as a plea against drugs originally written by Phillip k. Dick, who at the end list us the names of their friends killed or seriously damaged by the abuse of narcotic drugs. A list incredibly long, by the way. Thus the movie somewhat widely understood, but that not is saved from being boring and quite unnecessary.</body>
