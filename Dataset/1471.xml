	<body>Few news recently brings horror to cast bells on the fly by the announcement of another product grown under the protection of the Japanese influence and pertrechado all the clich√©s of the genre without missing any. Press is not bad of solemnity. Nor is it good. And mediocre will be an adjective like next you long when one has come out of the film and think of cold what scam they have released. It is not badly made, without being well invoiced. You don't have a script of bells as much as the poster fill with enthusiasm by the bizarre image and the idea of metaphysical strain. The actors are not bright. Not bad. Mediocre is an adjective that comes as long when one has come out of the film and think of cold bla bla bla.The inclusion of a cyber threat gives a point of novelty that collapses immediately when the director (it is possible that does not have no idea of the name and that does not have any commitment to hear) launches fully to develop his story, which is short, which could give Yes case that overnight had fallen it the task of direct it. Wes Craven, Christophe Gans, still delighted with scares of Silent Hill?In the end. Entertaining film (hence no discussion) that is forgotten quickly. Everything should be in the vineyard of the Lord. Feel like then (that Yes) compensate for the error with some tape of more substance, of those who do not leave us and stick to the senses during several days. Apocalypto for this scribe this year. O El laberinto del fauno, to name a cuasinacional product. And lifetime Jezebel of William Wyler film, but this is good (how wonderful, how wonderful) which has this our Vice: to compensate us of loves lost with old loves.</body>
