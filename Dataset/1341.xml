	<summary>A movie that could have been much more and is, sadly, in much less.</summary>
	<body>Yesterday, and thanks to Digital + (well, thanks to my pocket than the pay.) could enjoy a feature film which is for my all a pending issue, and, I had a time seeking the tape by videoclubes and libraries without success, finally ended up owner and Ã©cole! (as stated a mio teacher of the school), yesterday, without coming to tale ended up visionando.Kenneth Branagh famous to adapt to film over and over again the works of his countryman William Shakespeare, composed here a film where the lead takes Robert De Niro, Helena Bonham Carter, and Ian Holm, and where Branagh elongates in excess footage, being sometimes very heavy his viewing. If that a little unes you of drowsiness when it comes to see her, are facing a perfect tape for snooze on the couch.On the other hand, the ambiance, the costume and photography are excellent, even makeup De Niro turns into the famous monster who earlier gave life on-screen Boris Karloff, however, an extreme slowness, a slow and heavy way to go to the heart and a predictable skinny end please make the production of the same.The score Patrick Doyle composed for the film, gives notes both gothic horror and a perfect sound for a tape of these characteristics, it seems here Branagh has been able to choose the appropriate composer.In short, a film that could have been much more and is, sadly, in much less.</body>
