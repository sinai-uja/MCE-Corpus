	<body>You can have one of those stupid days, in that without waiting too, you leave lead and convince. The case is that I enjoyed with this story full of illusion and magnetism that without great pretensions, entretenie, which is already fairly.The movie begins with a function of magic in a theatre, and then a long flashback that occupies almost the entire history. Then returns to the starting point and is at this point where occurs for me when magic throughout the tape. That last number gave me the willies and I not stopped smiling.I have read several critical of the movie, and each one worse. However I disagree. I yes I thought the characters, thanks to Edward Norton capable of becoming a magician of overflowing personality and I became one spectator of their magic numbers. I also think that this is the great success. Numerous sequences in half light (such as the room of cinema), espectaci√≥n to the illusion of the number and admiration for its beauty.I admit that it may be simplistic, but is that I don't think have great pretensions, but of the own object of magic, entertain, and succeeds far, decorated with just the mystery and romance of time.But thanks to the inherent to all artistic expression subjective component there will be some who did not prevail and even bored, and others that accommodate in the armchair and are left to cajole by a beautiful illusion which in my opinion is worth.</body>
