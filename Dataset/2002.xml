	<body>Responsible for the Era of ice - his opera prima - Chris Wedge, returns to give us another enjoyable, funny, so rhythmic film as lack of heart and a little solvent and attractive script. Characters more flat that its funny prehistoric bugs, these robots are remedos human sleep, work, eat, need money and all the boring things we don't want to see in a movie of animation. More taking as reference to excellent films in this genre that is not worth listing.The story perhaps too simple, this time itself suitable for all audiences, without double reading as it happened for example with the great Shrek. Child/robot/poor who goes to the big city to succeed (does succeed it?). It is not that Robots will lack rhythm or much less, adrenaline is extra. At times it seems one in a game of an amusement park.The beginning is auspicious and even remembers the beginning of Minority Report of Spielberg (remedando his idol Kubrick), with a tone between bleak and winding and a future city mechanized, metallic and cold. The gag of the birth of the protagonist, is the most successful in the 91 minute a hilvanada film of them. But this is just the beginning.Full of cinematic events - music, Rocky, the magician of sickle Tin man, several (too many) to Star Wars - finally stands the gag - indeed very funny - the music of Britney Spears, but like everything else in the film, with little taste. In comparison, it is below the level of the Espanta sharks, Madagascar or bugs, and this is already much say.It could only improve it a little listening to a flawless - see vocal cast sheet below - in its original version, which I could not really enjoy. It is best put the disk of Daft Punk and dance with Robot Rock.</body>
