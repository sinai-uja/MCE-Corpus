	<body>Sometimes we think that already be a dandruff of the 1970s or 1980s it has to be something at least endearing or contribution entertainment. Because this is not the case that after the cameras lies one of the biggest useless of the horror film that goes by the name of William girdler which among other holdings decided to assassinate the Exorcist to take it to the black market. "What is called blackxplotation with the film Abby" was so blatant copying that the director was even denounced by plagiarism "." After some other type Grizzly disaster where the adventures of a killer bear that looked like a fucking cat I have on that occasion. With all this what they want tell hospital Satán? Nonsense since the start that even going to worse especially when the devil makes an appearance noticing this echo of plasticine. Among the actors only charles kissinger would make more movies, i.e. all the director's "nobody else do I contract". It is not surprising that none of them would act seeing levels of interpretation offered.Music, photography as nonexistent as an address or script. In short one of the worst films I've seen lately.</body>
