	<body>"We start with a handful of killings." Important people. Little people. "Just to prove that we not make distinctions".Mythical, brilliant, fun, fantastic (in all concepts) film that has gone through merits to the history of the cinema. Thanks to James Whale, an excellent director, misunderstood and reviled because of their sexual orientation, owner of her own universe, the film goes beyond the moment in which is going to be world heritage sites. View tens of years after its premiere, the movie has the same vigour, freshness and nasty than when performed. Everything about her is enduring, with magnificent interpretations, while Claude Rains more sexy and mischievous than ever, while threatening to head. A wonderful film with Gloria Stuart, the beloved elder of "Titanic" of charming female protagonist.</body>
