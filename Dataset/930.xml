	<body>One of the Christmas releases with more than likely success. Not in vain at the front is the Australian George Miller, creator and director of "Babe, the brave piglet". While some of you already know my weakness by child animation cinema, being objective, it has history, music, humor. entertain both children and adults. And thanks to the approach of the dance (it is almost a musical) brings something new and old at the same time, the classics of animation.It is not a purely child movie Ice Age style, but that as I have said, the dance is the cornerstone of the same, as element of communication, and against the background of the famous phrase of Chaplin: know yourself and try to be happy, but above all, know yourself. There are things in the story of the ugly duckling of the movie Billy Elliot, Darty Dancing in the dance, but then it was derived to the heroism of the protagonists of these stories, all this with a bit of social criticism in Hispanic communities and differentiating elements.The end becomes something innocent and utopian, but apart from good jokes, songs and musical numbers already worthwhile by itself alone. That Yes, you are one that go with the mind of a child to be able to enjoy, because if not, the nearly two hours more than one it will be long.</body>
