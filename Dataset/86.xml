	<summary>Capote is stinky feeling that one has to survive have to bait the rich</summary>
	<body>Capote, again, the question me of whether cinema can remain neutral with the reality. "Recently I saw in"7 virgins"to an unnamed rogue trying to force a girl of 12 years in front of a camera unperturbed, flaccid, a suspuestamente camera"objective".""Is that that is the reality," I say, "Who is the filmmaker to change anything?" It seems impossible to me a so easy to answer question: is a human being.Capote tells the story of a best seller. Truman Capote reads in the newspaper about a massacre in the State of Kansas and moves to follow the process closely. Known to the victims, known to the police. The murderers are captured in a short time. The writer gets to them. Get to delay the death sentence by hiring lawyers of luxury that they draw up appeals and arrive to the Kansas Supreme Court, the Federal Court?Capote not trafficking in that stinky feeling that one has that in the U.S. only only die executed the poor. Capote's stinky feeling that one has to survive in this world have to bait the rich. The writer maintains alive the two murderers because you need to know that awful night. You need to know that morbid world walking by the sensational programs and the gossip. Lengthens the life of the murderer as well as the audience takes account of income for those who give him bait.But Capote is a neutral film. The camera does not condemn what you see, everything seems right, or wrong, according as you look at it. Anything goes; same as a violation. If the camera at an angle it may violate a girl and nothing happens. What I say is that neutrality is unmentionable connivance with the executioner; and is not tolerable when there are victims.</body>
