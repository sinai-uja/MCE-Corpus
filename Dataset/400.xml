	<body>The Spanish film industry of the moment? the nostalgic (altristeces_aparte_-_parece_tener_únicamente_tres_patas:_1)? (intimate (2) generational comedy and 3) horror film. In the latter case, which is that we are discussing, it is too common to find with the topical American staff of the killer movie and the footprint of Amenábar on the claim of a return of the screw psicologista. Skizo we find this along with some clumsy remendados thriller ingredients. A couple of types are planning an absurd number resulting in an absurd abduction that is extended until the total incoherence in the abode of the murderer, a boy that the vision of the alien violence becomes psychopath (so parents take the therapeutic decision to lock him in a basement filled with sharp objects and delight you with sadomasochism sessions).The main asset of this film is Jaenada, who not it tries too hard with a role requiring him to be m3u I crappy and be m3u crazy half the time and look like a soap opera payasete the other ("size does matter!", jokes about a few picks). The rest of the actors, as if only spend out there. Psychological thriller that does not anguish and terror that not excited, however much that bend in plug heavy metal in the action scenes and do ROAR like a velociraptor to the small assassin. The final pegostrón, authentic shows to what extent can get desperate to remove over a film, seems only designed to arouse the Viewer.</body>
