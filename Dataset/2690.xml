	<body>Already in like God humor Shadyac offered was really child. Apart, the script was extremely bad and Jim Carrey was in his less graceful sauce. I do not know why this Director is you came shooting a sequel to, let me say, more unnecessary than many that have been released this year. Can turn into a kind of politician in a sort of Noe? Go by God, one sufficient reason to shoot the most expensive comedy in the history of the cinema. The spark is as simple, the script is still bad and therefore something has to change positively if I liked - a little - more than its predecessor: Steve Carrell. It is the core of the function, the only thing that really supports this disastrous comedy family. Forgive me if I'm going through, but it is this film promised enough and the truth has left me completely indifferent. To some they will grace some gags, but to at least recognize that they would not have the slightest grace in case not Carrell. Quite clear examples would be the scene of the tank or some that another facet comic made to terrify animals. And if I had said something else in favour of keep as God would be the spectacular special esfectos, which look more than ever in the final scene (from the Ark sailing throughout the city). Yes, this shows that the budget is scandalous, but this film is missing something, no personality, but grace. It could have been much, much better. And what do we do now? Because if the most expensive comedy is like this, already I do not imagine what will be more cheaper. Big budget, mediocre quality. Will many times have to hear this phrase for years? And not us olivdemos of the moral of the happy end, which already is her might have been spared.</body>
