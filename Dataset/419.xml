	<body>I saw a couple of years later released, as you must see Clerks: video and with friends. This film not impressive by its cinematography, but by the pace of his dialogues and his humor. Two guys that they are not going anywhere and twelve years later we have the second part. Definitely not to be seeing Clerks to appreciate this, but it is ideal.While these guys are not models to emulate they have incredible conversations and a sense of the peculiar humour. Of course they speak mostly about sex with morbidity and deviations, but also on film. On the difference between grow with the mythology of Star Wars versus the story of the Lord of the rings. Only by that comment worth throughout the film. Kevin Smith manages to satirize his characters without reducing them, why is a sincere reflection on life and not a mockery.It has moments that are perhaps too sugary and sentimentalistas, but who knows needs them to withstand ametralladoramente funny from the rest. Although it may not seem it say something about live in mediocrity, and change the romantic dreams by sensible things. Love and friendship is based on another person to be able to see you as you are and capture your essence. As this film says a lot without going beyond, and it can only be valuable if you see by what it is and you laugh much.</body>
