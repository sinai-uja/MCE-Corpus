	<summary>Classical French comedy full of originality that wasted talent.</summary>
	<body>A few years ago, the dinner of idiots became an unexpected critical and box office success. Its wacky plot, full of unexpected twists and picturesque situations captivated the public. Now, what was its director, Francis Veber, returns with the game the idiots, another comedy full of vitriol, wit and good humor. Pierre Levasseur is a billionaire who one day the gossip reporters photograph down the street with her lover, a famous model. To avoid a costly divorce, not think another thing trying to convince his wife that the explosive blonde of the photo wasn't going with him, but with Fran√ßois Pignon, a passerby who coincidentally passing by and was reflected in the snapshot. To give plausibility to this Assembly, sent to Elena (his concubine) to live in house of Pignon, a modest accommodation of official protection in a humble neighborhood in which the model will live situations discussed and picturesque, to the delight of the Viewer. The cast is very well balanced, although it is missing to the sadly deceased Jacques Villeret, protagonist of the dinner of idiots. GAD Elmaleh, Alice Taglioni and Daniel Auteuil meet perfectly, and Kristin Scott Thomas is superb in his role as wife. The game of idiots is a great movie, with all the virtues of the best French comedy, and demonstrates to make people laugh is not necessary to have a cast full of histriones nor of fantastic situations. Just needed a good script, alertness and players who does not intend to focus all attention on his character. And this film has all of these, go to if it has.</body>
