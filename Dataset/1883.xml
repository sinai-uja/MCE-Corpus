	<body>Before the overwhelming majority of reviews positive heme here again disitiendo. It is not that the film has not liked, something that well was, but the lack of creativity to paint the characters. Made me a very long film to tell the history that had to tell and above all more American history of the films of the old continent I saw lately.With some exceptions, I usually consider the American film as easy cinema, for recreation. With this I am not saying that it is good or bad, each will have their tastes. But is itself a film too explained almost stereotypical characters and linear stories that for good or for evil seek to satisfy everyone.The lives of others has many of these characteristics. Its development is almost accommodating. It has in its representatives of the regime to characters that cause aversion. There is no contrast, the villain is just that. There is also a climber that exercises its power with arrogance and of course our protagonist who ends in love with art as it could not be otherwise changes life and his perspective on things.Always there are viewers looking for messages in the films, to all them perhaps sufficient conviction that all art it can, that the ideas are not killed and that sooner or later the good triumphs over evil (although in this case the triumph is something so alien to the core of the story as the fall of the wall).I read somewhere that after winning the Oscar for best foreign language film in Hollywood already they are thinking about doing a remake. I can assure you that the adaptation will be very simple, I think that only suffice to translate it into English.</body>
