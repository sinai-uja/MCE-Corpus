	<summary>To relax in the easy chair, open mind, and not raise too many things. Just enjoy the characters and fantasy.</summary>
	<body>I liked the last of the most famous Hollywood Indian, although I have to say that it is a dangerous movie, of those that does not leave indifferent. Either you like or you will seem ridiculous. It is a fantastic tale you must see wanting to believe.It is not a movie of action, not even fear. It is a tale, strange by where and how it develops, but charming. I understand that may seem a joke, but I will not leave applauded at a rate capable of writing something like this and have the courage to take it to the movies, with the risk involved.So to relax in the easy chair, open mind, and not pose too much. Only to enjoy with the characters and the fantastic (and sometimes absurd) history.</body>
