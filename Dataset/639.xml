	<body>Sad is that the work of Jason Reitman (not confused with Ivan) has not taken place for brand new in our country before this tasteless work debut "Thank you for smoking". His short films "Uncle Sam" and "In God we trust" already made him famous in various festivals by its sharp acid humor and exaggerated critical sense.To "Thank you for smoking" a firm opinion about the tobacco industry criticizes can disrespect, but any viewer can understand the complexities to which the director has faced, although my taste just deepen the wound.In the film it is much discussed, refers to endless, are given all possible laps to the issues raised in some moments comes to the spectator, blame, bore a narrative plot well linked and a wonderful group of actors in State of grace, beautifully directed toward the more sarcastic side of human beings.</body>
