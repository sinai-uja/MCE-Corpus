	<summary>4 Types an excuse to lose on a motorcycle for the America more garrula.</summary>
	<body>With a more than curious presentation of characters, went somewhat surprised and excepticos to this meeting of has-beens, where Travolta, Tim allen and William H.Macy, seem to the parents of Martin Lawrence, perhaps the "youngest" of the 4 protagonists of this, tribute to the current cinema, where is played over and over again with the typical clich√©s, which sometimes reach tireangry and bored staff.And it seems that for a time this part, it is fruitful (in box office), that honor and remember genera, although this film seems more the excuse of the 4 players to realize a return by the States, that a solid script of a comedy.With a full soundtrack of hits, and is that a tape of these features without known music would be a disappointment, if it is not already, certainly curious the America deeper American, with their contests in chile, his Madrid and its Sheriff of palo.And where there are also actors such as Ray Liotta or a curious Oscar winner, I mean Marisa Tomei by this girl do not pass the years?It is clear that the tape will not go to the history of cinema, but if he has succeeded in these 4 grandpas"almost" is it so big at the expense of the shooting of the film.PS: does Travolta dyed hair?</body>
