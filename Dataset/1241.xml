	<summary>A film unnecessary, ostentatious and that stays in a ridiculous attempt to continue with the fame and prestige that gave him the Rings trilogy.</summary>
	<body>Some remakes sound very bad nothing more mention, others interest depending on who perform and others bother to call them remake and not "tribute".In the case of King Kong, it was very difficult to beat the original, but the fame that preceded Peter Jackson and his love for the film could suspect a return of nut made with love and great respect.But only by knowing the three hours and something of the film happens sound interesting to provoke serious suspicion and even some fear. What may Jackson have added in the version of a film that lasts approximately half? Because the "fill" is not worth much.One of the aspects most care of the film is the recreation historical, very well done and supported by an outstanding art direction; the animation of the Kong is very successful and very human scale (with reason some enlightened support certain proposals: P), actors that are fairly decent? but without a doubt the best of the film is Naomi Watts, Naomi Watts and Naomi Watts.Ahora story cons: duration, charisma pomposity of Jackson reflected in countless and repetitive flat impossible (and many of them air), some sequences of surprisingly boring and topical action and with a few digital effects which at times are disastrous and shameful. And not I list all inexplicably stupid details and give you nudges to dinosaurs, the girl nor maree with so much wiggle in the hand of the Kong, etc? That if you have great moments between the eighth wonder of the world and Watts which are really suggestive, but which do not compensate for a film unnecessary, ostentatious and remains in a ridiculous attempt to continue with the fame and prestige that gave him the Rings trilogy.</body>
