	<body>Palindromes is not the great Solondz film, but can be seen. "In fact, it is light years of"Welcome to the doll's House"or"Happiness", and not so far from"Things that don't forget", where the suspicion over the horizon.""Palindromes" is the least round work of its director, but this does not prevent a couple of good times 100% Solondz.En this "story", we witness the journey undertaken by Aviva, character with a multitude of faces, (the only known is that of Jennifer JasonLeigh), a twelve year old girl who runs away from his home to feel misunderstood. And it is that you want to become pregnant. The journey of Aviva (hence about palindromes: Word or phrase that reads just as left to right, than from right to left, as Ana) leaves in its infancy which undertook the prota of the dreamlike "Big fish", with references to "Stop the monsters" and a Jet humor (this musical performance) marks of the House, with their respective deaths and their respective violationsit of course.Faces forgotten, as Ellen Barkin or Richard Masur hold the pull, although they appear and disappear without warning, among a lot of amateur actors. In summary, a small disappointment of a director who must and surely that will make it, fill us with life with his dirty stories of sinners, he rejected, marginalized and "different" in as he filled it before. A sentence: "it is not yet a baby, is like a tumor". 5.</body>
