	<summary>Blake Edwards set an expression deserves to be included in the anthology of film humor, of their potential for a concise representation of the slope more pathetic and ridiculous of human society, and its ability to provoke laughter with the use of the more vulgar gesture.</summary>
	<body>Blake Edwards directed this comedy about the adventures of a trapped Hindu in 1968 between the glamour of high society of Hollywood, drawing a close to a myth so vacuous and Mannerist profile as the of the "noble savage" and so in vogue in those prone 1960s towards Orientalism. The film has air of parody, and can be understood as a social satire in the service of the skills of the main actor. Certainly, all timeless which can be found in this classic (classic, despite everything), is the charisma and the containment of Peter Sellers, who achieved the feat of resolving an irregular aggregate of clumsiness with dignity ranging from the cynical humor (quite delusional at times) to the bland joke. But a charisma does a film, nor imitation silent if this is not accompanied by sufficient packaging in relation to the proposed topic, or the content (it is a satire too inoffensive and hierarchical, with which this imitation of the visual does not exceed the complacency of the product).A brilliant performance with one-handed sober as of Blake Edwards set an expression worthy to be included in the anthology of the film's humor, albeit only to discriminate what in this genre - so abused for a long time - is valuable and what is futile, i.e. of its potential for a concise of the slope more pathetic and ridiculous of human society representation , and its ability to provoke laughter with the use of the vulgar (and lacking in creativity) gesture.</body>
