	<summary>Flags convinces the Director, students and parents, but still has to convince the public</summary>
	<body>Antonio Banderas makes Pierre Dulaine, a teacher of ballroom dancing, inspired by real life, seeking to bring forward an optional institutes oriented difficult children. First you have to convince the Director, then to the students, and finally parents. Is it good for something learn ballroom dancing in high school? Still has to convince the public.This is a case of film with interesting question. Dulaine provides several answers: "if their children learn to dance couples will learn to respect themselves," says to parents. The stories of the boys also want to demonstrate that it is worth. There are two students who are Romeo and Juliet, by the mess of family squabbles, a boy with complexes, a couple anti-snob and anti-racista compulsory presence, and a trio with jealousy that learn to express themselves with music.The creators did not seem to stay convinced these stories of students, nor with the sentences of the professor. They decided that if they wanted the film to function there had to be a competition and a prize. It's an enshrined formula that is too easy but on the other hand has always worked. I am not much interested discussing whether go old ways is good or bad cinema. He everyone tolerated according to their level of fatigue. But I was very much interested in the idea of the ballroom dancing as optional. The only thing I regret is to discover that the film is not the best forum to discuss educational proposals. It is good to propose them, but not to discuss them. Think that the stories of love and the third act which always has a thread earrings consume three-quarters parts of any story you want to retrieve invested.</body>
