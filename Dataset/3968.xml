	<body>No! Noooooooooooooooooooooo! Thousand times I will continue denying it the master ARGENTO! Remember the other two parties? SUSPIRIA and INFERNO were the highest flight of the great Italian director than before already left its dark red or zoophilia trilogy. They were not films about zoophilia I refer to those titles with names of animals, the bird with the Crystal plumage for example.All these works reflected the extremely macabre artist brand, where the killings were shot as if it were a precious painting, music wanted to be devastating in the work of GOBLIN, aesthetics seeping elegance on all four sides. That artist dead and instead presents a third zero on all fronts, fatal his daughter ASIA ARGENTO which previously collaborated in Trauma or the Phantom of the opera, also saves the veteran UDO KIER which already appeared in the first part SUSPIRIA and is current with his participation in the ROB ZOMBIE HALLOWEEN.Appears to the Mise en scène of a vulgar movie, special effects are joke, the non-existent picture, the script nor means demonstrating the fall dive of the erstwhile wonderful director if recalls other mediocre titles shot lately as the player or just Insomnio.Tan some loose murder reminds us of his early works.</body>
