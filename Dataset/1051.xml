	<body>Al Gore is a guy ready. And for several reasons. An inconvenient truth, directed by Davis Guggenheim, has allowed him to enter the world of the documentary film of an extraordinary, unique and simple way. This wonderful documentary talks about global warming in a very entertaining and unpredictable manner that makes Gore - Bush rival candidate in the US election of several years ago – to become this ready guy that was at the beginning. This inconvenient truth we face is a real event that occurs constantly in our world and that, obviously, has to solve. One when he hears global warming and prompt you to a humane solution stays quiet in normal state. Another thing is that they propose you to know or understand that global warming by many human solution you may have, cause it us. Yes, we humans. This is how Al Gore we have glued to the seat, with this simple phrase (and subsequent solutions approach, of course): global warming produce us. Of course, that if one is interested in a cumin ecology, the environment and all this nor you will be interested an inconvenient truth. The Guggenheim film aims to inform everyone of this terrible fact, but also knows Guggenheim, that not all us interested, so here the public decides. Do not only the most interesting of this documentary is to realize that these drastic events we are constantly witnessing? like Katrina, excessive consumption of energy?-cause them us, but you also see in the way how moves this message: required, entretenidísima and interesting. The message that I send to the public would be as follows: do not miss an inconvenient truth, as necessary.</body>
