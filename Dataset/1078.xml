	<summary>It is not only one of the great films of the year, the best end of year film that we could get, but that is one of the best films of recent years, you hit, you removed, you move.</summary>
	<body>Alejandro González Iñárritu presents Babel, the third episode of the trilogy about the human soul, after the excellent Amores Perros (passion) and 21 grams (loss) two tapes that its own right have become representatives of the best films of recent years. This episode talks about the incommunicado detention and the compassion and new director faces their characters to the tragedy and connect directly or indirectly.In Babel fortuitous shot is the core of the story, an American couple formed by Susan and Richard (Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt) carried out a tourist trip by Morocco to try to overcome a crisis, two Moroccan children playing with a rifle and they shoot at a bus wounding Susan, meanwhile, in United States the nanny, an immigrant Mexican (Adriana Barraza)want to attend the wedding of his son which takes place in Mexico, as the accident happened in Morocco has made it impossible to find a substitute, you risk with children cross the border in the company of his nephew (Gael García Bernal), finally in Tokyo, Chieko a young deaf (Rinko Kikuchi), traumatized by her mother's suicide, looking for a man to lose his virginity and discovers that his father is being already investigated that the rifle It was owned by him. This tape live in five languages, English, French, Spanish, Arabic and Japanese so see it dubbed version would lose its meaning so here recommend search projections that are in original version.The origin.Babel not only closes a trilogy, but that means the end of the relationship between two of the geniuses who have emerged in recent years that are responsible for a way of making films that has influenced other filmmakers, on the one hand, the director Alejandro González Iñárritu and on the other the screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga. The official reason, Arriaga wants to fly solo and switch to the direction, the unofficial reason, González Iñárritu has had enough of the writer that requires to be present throughout the creative process of a film, from now we will have to see how González Iñárritu wheel without the support of the scripts of Arriaga and how the writer unfolds after the cameras.As in Amores Perros and 21 grams, González Iñárritu returned to disestablishment mounting history making a puzzle but to a lesser extent than in their previous titles something that was just thanking. But still beating the Viewer to show as few tear of the characters, I will give three examples but there are many more, Richard the character played by Brad Pitt in the hospital with his woman's life hanging by a thread and talking on the phone with her little boy and trying unsuccessfully to avoid crying, Amelia, the Mexican babysitter on the verge of exhaustion trying to seek help to cross the border with fatal consequences, and finally Cheiko trying to keep his first sexual encounter with the police that investigates his father. Also returns to prove that it is an excellent director of actors, if in Amores Perros, we discovered Gael García Bernal and showed us the Canarian Goya Toledo is a superb and missed actress like few and made three great actors of the stature of Sean Penn, Naomi Watts and Benicio del Toro shimmering as they had never done in 21 gramsin Babel it brings together three consecrated stars such as Gael García Bernal, Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett, with virtually unknown actors such as the Mexican Adriana Barraza or Japanese Rinko Kikuchi and with non-professional actors as children causing Moroccans of the accident, all of them make an extraordinary job, protruding Barraza, Kikuchi and an impressive Brad Pitt who moves from her first scenea simple conversation partner on the terrace of a bar, has never been better.The despair.Since last may, date in which Babel was presented at the Cannes Festival, where González Iñárritu won the award for best director, was eager to watch this movie and saw no time in which reached our billboards, now that I've finally seen I noticed that has been worth the wait because no doubt Babel is not just one of the great films of the yearthe best final year film that we could receive, but it is one of the best films of recent years, you hit, you removes, moves you and tells you that everyone on this planet is interconnected and that to accept that we must learn to communicate.</body>
