	<body>We will start clarifying the tape there is no history, that the argument is so simple that in some moments raya the absurd, and that 2: 10 min. that hard, are just an excuse to get the robots when more time on screen better than best, sitting the bases and admitted everything bad in the tape, must admit (with the hand on the heart) that I I had as a boy child, and it is that see both to the transformers (those that enjoyed on TV in my childhood), as this action packed film, explosions and special effects, make that time which has lasted for the projection it has happened to me in a pis-pas, and the ALAAAAAA! I has left the mouth in at least a hundred times.Always say, repeat, and requeterepito, (ea!) that one can not go to see, with the same claims, "Transformers" that any more or less serious film tape, gentlemen, this is a summer blockbuster made only intended to entertain, getting 2 hours of footage to pass in a "santiamen" and we eat popcorn and we drink coca-cola of rigourwithout looking deeper (which there), or greater significance (which does not exist).The soundtrack, epic online that likes Michael Bay in his films, in some moments and closing their eyes, just listening to the music, I've transported both "Armaggedom" and "The island", musically speaking, is that epic chords and that characteristic sound, only appears in the films of M.BayLos special effectsbrilliantly created by ILM, and is that, gentlemen, in view of the robots, its transformations and movements (the fight scenes aren't so confusing as, for example, in "Spiderman 3") seem to as well as credible, 100% real; It is even easy to fond is with according to digital characters, a merit by the CGI animators.And last but by no means least, we have the interpretations, the vast majority of them simple, and where the only ones that stand out are Shia LaBeouf (which soon will see making company "Indy", Megan Fox, more than his "acting" I focus in its beauty, great body and big eyes, Jon Voight, trying to give something to her role as vacuum packaging)John Turturro, who has sincerely dose 0 for comedy, as well as Josh Duhamel, which I have not been able to off of her character in "Las Vegas" TV series.Since then that his script has more gaps and holes than any other film of similar characteristics, but well, you're the film happy with apparently and no other claim, if the script had already accompanied if that had been the milk.</body>
