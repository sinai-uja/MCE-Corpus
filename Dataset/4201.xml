	<body>After the enormous success of the 2003 of the irregular adaptation of the brilliant comic book created some fifty years ago by the great Ibáñez could not doubt a sequel which of course repeat step by step the foundations of the original but be changed a couple of names. The head on this occasion is Miguel Bardem author of the ugliest women of the world or twelfth night that already had some similarity to a comic book by the form of their images, replaces the main player Benito Pocino which physically seemed much more in tune for the role but I guess that the much greater popularity of the neng Edu soto earned him the game. Otherwise the cast returns to also repeat the same situations in some brilliant special effects that end up getting tired by repetitive.Clearly some scenes are really funny but most GAGS are forced without at any time approaching the original spirit of the adventures on paper, something that unfortunately already could presuppose.The best returns to the talent of the Pepe Viyuela comic which creates a perfect Filemon with the perfect loser vitola, teammate I finished convincing nor here neither as a comedian. Film forced that after repeated at every shot ends up being heavy and without the necessary grace.</body>
