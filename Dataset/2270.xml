	<body>Interesting work, which deals with a real criminal history that has already inspired some other films. It is not bad, being entertaining at all times. Performers do well, especially Salma Hayek and James Gandolfini.La atmosphere is perfect (the action takes place shortly after the end of World War II).However, I do not liked much to say, since the history of the two criminals already had seen before, narrated from another point of view, in "Deep crimson", Arturo Ripstein, with the surprise and my personal interest in the plot, was rather diluted.It is true, however, that "Lonely Hearts" is not a remake because the script deals with the story from the points of view, both the pair of criminals, and the couple of policemen that tenaciously follow the track.And interesting parallelism, the points in common, which have in common some characters that are not, on the other hand, more different from one another. I am referring to the abominable character of Salma Hayek and the tormented police soberly interpreted by John Travolta.Esta dichotomy is well reflected, above all in the interrogation scene.Punishment, in my opinion, is that the development of the story fails to be as efficient as its presentation, as its inception, truly impressive. Their first minutes, the presentation of the film, are the best, while duran credits. Then it is irregular, although technically is impeccable.The realization, rather conventional, is what makes this work does not reach the altitude that certainly deserved. But entertaining enough, although you can ask you more.</body>
