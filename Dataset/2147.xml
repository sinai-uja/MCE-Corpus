	<summary>Another tape more than court youth action once again left in one of so many. Best of the tape without a doubt are precious London exterior...</summary>
	<body>Again throw book and before comment on the tape that brings us, I like to do a little reminder of a film in 1991 and directed by William Dear, under the title of "Junior agent" was a comedy for the absolute showcasing rising star (Richard Grieco who knows where walk now?), and that somehow reminds me of a little film of which I will speak now.I've been a long season reading network things about this movie, the first that was to perform on the character created by Anthony Horowitz (will be the first and the last, because the tape has been a failure at the box office), a species of J.K.Rowling of Juvenile literature (this time set in the action and not the magic of Potter), and where, after an unusual opening credits, which relates somehow to Alex Rider with a sort of James Bond youth; impossible on the other hand not compare them, US launches a simple argument where Ewan Mcgregor makes a small (but intense) role, and Alicia Silverstone returns roaring; This girl since that was "Fatgirl" (I say) "Batgirl" never again became namely her film, also featured Billy Nighy (here without makeup) and Andy "Gollum" Serkis, this takes the makeup that does the other.Curious its duration, and is that, if the tape lasted most of the hour and a half of rigour, kids (remember that you can not go to another sector of the population), they would end up hating the film, and is that some action scenes are so extremely loggerhead and child that one cannot more than laugh with amazement of this nonsense, and I understand that when you see a tape of these characteristics made leaving the brain at home, but some things rallan absurdity.When I I have been documenting told in some websites, which had to be something more scratching the surface of the tape to see beyond the original premise, sorry to contradict this, if we scratch more, do not see anything (sad, but real).Best of the tape without a doubt are precious London exterior, and it is that, as I was in September, I have love of London and all its city represents.</body>
