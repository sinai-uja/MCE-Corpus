	<summary>I never aplastaré an Ant. Do if arriving home we give them these candies that when it masticas them crumble?</summary>
	<body>Perhaps it has something more field than "other film critics", but at any moment in the film I doubted that the sinister bugs on which our little protagonist flies are wasps. The first indication about its nature is that they are quite nasty, the second is that they are equipped with Sting, and the third and most unavoidable is that feed on other insects.Surprisingly, today I went to see the movie, this morning. To my small you really wanted see her for some time and is almost retired from the poster, so we have gone to see it in IMAX, as high as a 7-storey building on-screen and in 3 dimensions. Criticism of the small of the House is as follows: "never again aplastaré an Ant." Do if arriving home we give them these candies that when it masticas them crumble? "." objective fulfilled, has not moved from his seat in the 8 minutes long. He said that he loved and that when we return.As for the argument, for nothing has seemed to me repetitive or similar to "Antz" or "Affection have shrunk to children", unlike other children, it has got me thrill without resorting to the Elimination of the parental figures. With regard to the child, not thought me that was "fun killing ants from your garden", rather used them as a way of expressing anger that was not able to desccargar against the bully in the neighborhood that turned out to be too big.Perhaps the fault has been the 3 dimensions, or maybe not, but agree with my son and give an excellent film. Even a child of 4 years is able to perceive some of the messages of higher moral of the movie load, such as that of the evil that is attacking a few ants just for fun.</body>
