	<body>I was surprised to hear that in a film of the disastrous DARREL ROODT Director among other pearls of Dracula 3000 or enemy No. 1 public my father could count in a series b budget with two performers of some standing.BRIDGET MOYNAHAN starred real blockbusters like me for example robot. Meanwhile PETER WELLER is the unforgettable protagonist of ROBOCOP. Only to see both protagonists, I decided to take a look making a big mistake. Another film about murderous animals in is occasion lions, which seems a copy of CUJO adapted to the ferocity of these cats.Family trapped in a car to withstand the onslaught of the beasts all done without the slightest narrative style, with very poor special effects, a chaotic screenplay, typical production that not desentonaría in the timeslot of Teleplays in antena 3. Its two protagonists contribute something ex officio in the mess.</body>
