	<summary>To be the comedy more tontuna and Anderson light known to little, normal movie indie cool season and not a masterpiece. Work less well.</summary>
	<body>The Darjeeling Limited is the coldest movie of Wes Anderson. This means that it is more like Little Miss Sunshine to The Royal Tenenbaums. Let me explain.The Anderson tapes are own stories that there is no adapted to the fictional film and though this film is also, and probably more than any of his other works, is the coldest and the less feeling reflected.It is a little strange because the performances are brilliant (splendid Wilson) but never one of the brothers you imported as well as Max Fischer, Richie Tenenbaum or Steve Zissou.Es the first "pure comedy" Anderson, perhaps why the lack of feeling.Great ideas and planazos (and zooms, clear) House brand are not missing, but on this occasion they seem stuck with shoehorn and almost they Squeak by Grand, but then the director is marked the best sequence of the film doing just that and leaving the viewer / hooliganderson that sweet and sour flavor that you have when your team plays sobrado doing the best party of the year and is left to tie.</body>
