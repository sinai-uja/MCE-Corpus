	<body>I admit that I have a certain weakness for German films. The streets, the houses. remind me of the time I lived there, and I tend to see with good eyes. However, that is not the only reason why I left to see "Summer in Berlin" with the feeling of seeing a good movie for those who often go unnoticed and is fortunate to have not let slip. It is a simple story about the relationship between two friends and the small problems that can appear in the daily life of any person. This may seem easy, isn't it at all. How portray the everyday without being boring? How not just the obvious? Director Andreas Dresen manages with the help of the two actresses protagonists, the viewer comes to be interested by the lives of these two women, at the same time is that of so many others. Maybe, these small moments portrayed with great skill: the tasks as a carer for the elderly of Nike or the fruitless search for Katrin work (with those stupid personnel selection methods). The worst, the simplicity of some characters, - especially of the man which is interposed between the two - that cause that the overall impression of the film is not as good as what could have been. In any case, one of those movies that is worthwhile to see before her removed from theaters. And lucky you have projections in original version in your cities.</body>
