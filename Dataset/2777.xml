	<summary>"Flight plan: missing" has the privilege of being the first film that qualify with the note "Fucking shit", in what will be a resource "chanante" which I will apply to infumables films that put me between the eyes now.</summary>
	<body>This movie, if he had shot ten or twelve years ago would have been a luxury vehicle for Stallone, Schwarzenegger or Seagal, but now the shift is of Jodie.Si the horrible film of Robert Schwentke had of prota, Bruce Willis or Harrison Ford, at least have action and among the passengers would have at least a dozen "henchmen", but now the shift is of Jodie.Da shame of others at times (the incident with the Arabs)(, which as well as being out of place it contradicts the plot, at the end it turns out that Jodie had no reason and therefore lost the papers), falls into the ridiculous (the applause from the crew) and ends with the patience of the Viewer, which far from empathize with Jodie, just wants someone to do her silence with a good kick in the mouth (I do not even think of salad of hosts that I would give if I am in that) (flight, her sweats me to it whether or not it is batty)."I am not going to summarize the argument, because last night I slept fatal and I think that the fault lies with this"masterpiece"of the zafiedad.""Flight plan: missing" has the privilege of being the first film that qualify with the note "Fucking shit", in what will be a resource "chanante" which I will apply to infumables films that put me between the eyes from now (and which is equivalent to 0, for purists) A phrase: "Only has six years." People do things morbid with girls aged six.</body>
