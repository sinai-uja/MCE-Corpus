	<summary>Highly recommended film for all the fans of bat man, that if not recommended to minors...</summary>
	<body>Difficult without a doubt is that Christopher Nolan films such as "Memento" on their backs and "Insomnia" both two masterpieces of contemporary cinema, make the new release (the 5th already) of the bat man a simplistic and mediocre film (miresen history of Daredevil, Elektra, The punisher or the worst of all.) (CATWOMAN).Nolan made a good film that delves into the youth of the hero of Gotham, a city less Gothic that which proposed us Burton in the first two Batman (the Schumacher step refer!)(Hala!), with an excellent roster of the actors, even though Bale take the lead and is "that gets" in the role of Bruce Wayne / Batman.En two hours and peak of projection gives time to all, to see the reasons why the young Wayne builds his life on the way to revenge the death of his parents and their true motivations, and as happens to be victim to executioner of all those who break the law in Gotham, his city.But, of course, all that glitters is not gold and yet there than other negative part, for example mounting fast action scenes, poorly coordinated and poorly focused, there is no detail and in the dark trying to hide the shortcomings of these, perhaps the only negative note.In short, a highly recommended film for all the fans of bat man, that if not recommended to minors.</body>
