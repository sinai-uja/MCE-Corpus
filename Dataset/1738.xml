	<body>There are some characters that without knowing very well why, become true icons without borders, and there is no doubt that Mr. Bean is one of them. Despite his limited appearance in television (only 18 episodes in 5 years), the character became very popular and catapulted to fame to his interpreter, Rowan Atkinson, both that it is very difficult to separate them. Mr. Bean does not respond to the prototype of English, full of fine irony and subtle humor, but it is a more basic and simple, humor almost pure MIME. Ten years after starring in his first film, Mr. Bean returns with more force than ever and threatening to visit the beaches of Cannes the days in which the most important world cinema festival is held. Vacation Mr. Bean is a comedy crazy without pretensions, except the cause laugh after laugh in the Viewer. In this sense is an honest, that doesn't fool anyone, and film that offers what it promises, which, and although it hurts to say it, because today is worthy. Obviously, those who don't like the type of humor of Mr. Bean, this film les horrorizará, but those to those who like the character not stop laughing from the beginning until the end.The character resembles more to the of the television series that the of the previous film, barely does not speak, and his simple but effective comedy is based on the continuous slapstick. There are times really hilarious, like the scene in the restaurant (great Jean Rochefort), or the "operatic" sequence in the middle of the market. Special mention deserves all the acid retranca accompanies the character of Willem Dafoe and the presentation at the Cannes film festival. Vacation Mr. Bean is a comedy that meets perfectly its task: to pass a very fun time viewers.</body>
