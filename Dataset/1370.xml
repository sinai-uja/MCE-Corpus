	<body>By-product of teenage fattening which not is missing almost nothing to be declared the worst movie of recent years. And it also seems that it makes two made. It could have then entered directly on the shelves of dvd in the video shops: there sure has its audience. That how I fell so low? Because the brain sometimes dismissive of cinefilias and other paraphernalia of worship ego all have inside and let it contaminate by peccadilloes innocent for power then (at the caf√©, on the tail of bread, in these rinconcitos of the network) rant to taste and use these adjectives scoundrels who seldom use and we both like.I boot: infamous, banal, hollow, minimum. But after these four denominations, warn that my vocabulary will be always extremely short, prudent in its voluntary harassment, and that there will be someone with more nasty semantic (I have today a happy day and until I can think of two or three bondados of the film, which I am not going to say because'm me not the WINS) that disfigures this grain of pus in the worldwide charts.
