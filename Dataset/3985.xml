	<summary>A simplistic tape television of fast consumption and where only looks "something" Kyra Sedgwick, the rest or even serve to highlight them all, bored to own and strangers.</summary>
	<body>How quickly have broken one of my good intentions for 2008, and it is that, he thought devoted the year 2008 to see "Good cinema" and, yesterday, while my wife was zapping, in some channel whose name I do not remember, put this film, that being the debut in the direction of the actor Kevin Bacon, is also more simple, sosasleeping, stupid, predictable, empty, and without any possible interest.Perhaps, the only grace of the tape is in seeing how well that brings their 40 and many spring now-television (thanks to "The Closer") Kyra Sedgwick, or as Kevin Bacon once more becomes a (very well marked) character opposite to everything we know, Sandra Bullock, Oliver Platt, Marisa Tomei and Matt Dillon complete the cast in small rolescasually over the bulk of the film.Moreover, we face the umpteenth loaded with the usual telefilm which adds nothing, nor even comes to excite the Viewer, and that a server given desire to stay asleep on the couch (doubt if sometime I did for sure), on the other hand, and removing that a television film of this type can not ask you morea ridiculous exercise would be the requirement. I get no more, a simplistic television tape of fast consumption and where only looks "something" Kyra Sedgwick, the rest or even serve to highlight them all, bored to own and strangers.</body>
