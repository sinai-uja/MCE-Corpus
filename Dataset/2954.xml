	<body>Pixar has done again it. 'Ratatouille' is one of the most original and fresh arguments that Pixar has had in recent years (although 'The Incredibles' I like superior, at least in what regards to entertainment), and offered the film in a long time.The script is wonderful and perfect execution. The character design is the very best of Pixar (a parrot with the critic, and the own protagonist, called Rémy rat), and technically is the best movie of the story computer animation (something that will be overcome soon, seen the pace that leads the technology).Only a small paste: the subplot with relatives and colleagues of Rémy, which seemed quite tired and I pulled in a bad way of rewarding rhythm which bore the tape until they make Act of presence the above. Fortunately that is something fleeting.Since then, how far has been this sosez called 'Cars'!</body>
