	<body>Absurd, it has no feet or head; They could sell us as Epic Movie in the Shrek universe, which colaría. Vanished nasty breathed in the first part. All the gags are repetitive, jokes have no or a minimum of grace (falls, blows, the burping and the flatulence do grace: feel sorry for), and it is full of useless and shameful moments. It could be perfectly with half of the fingers of one hand everything what has made me a bit of grace throughout the film (the princesses, the end, and credits). If even small children have laughed shortly!.Above, for which lasts (time and a half), me has become very long. And to make matters worse, final moral tontorrona, easy and descaradísima, falling in the same topical disneyanos that both derided in Shrek 1.Un "caca-culo - fart-pis" of zillions of dollars that elevates the masterpiece category to its predecessors. Totally expendable.</body>
