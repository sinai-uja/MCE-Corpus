	<body>Both a server and another critic Muchocine.net who accompanied me to the press pass we went quite disheartened to this media, in fact, in some moments pass us burl√°bamos the recent fashion to films with penguins (animal I love), but it appears a persistent lack of ideas in the industry, in fact at some point confundiamos Happy Feet and cute penguins of Madagascar with these other birds actors.However, once starts the tape, with the soundtrack of Greenday one begins to quickly feel in tune with the protagonists, to fall in history, already laughing over and over again (with strange and nothing stupid jokes), with everything what we have on screen.Already commented that neat animation of water, as the fur of the penguins touches both the realism and the most perfect perfection, and is, there is no doubt that the liquid element is perhaps the most dificl translated as animation digital is concerned, times are moving is a lot, no doubt.History, with its final moralina is well reflected, and the characters have all something to tell us, from Cody the protagonist until Nice chicken surfer accompanying, sometimes made us smile in others make us shudder us and even detract from our eyes, well, we all have in one way or another our heart.Just a summer surprise that as an excuse to always take the kids to the movies, we can see the biggest and amazed at well done that is.</body>
