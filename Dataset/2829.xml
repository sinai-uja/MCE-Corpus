	<body>It should have been released the same weekend as the movie of the Simpsons, but the criterion of the Spanish distributors will have certainly been "direct to dvd" in another brilliant demonstration that not only Spanish film also weakens the conditions in which is displayed the foreign.The film starred by the without par duo is a species of sunset on the day of the immortal The Blues Brothers adapted for the young rockers fumetas inhabiting on the globe.Perhaps the deeper can Jigsaw is the message, la moraleja, that my personally I have come to the soul SPOILER: by very brilliant to be what you do, if not the pauntas in a paper you are going to forget after you smoke a cachimba.Two losers (one more than another) join forces to make with the secret of the rock: a Satanic spike built from a comillo of the Beelzebub himself is responsible for the success of the largest in the history of the Rock.JB and KG put hands to work to reach the Rock Museum, warned of the danger for a brilliant cameo that not I deberiáis lose.The start of the movie includes a musical number which removes the hiccups: she gave Meat Loaf and a JB baby that was already in Super Nacho.Para see in subtitled ORIGINAL version. It produces Ben Stiller and is already on my bookshelf, and Hot Fuzz Blades of Glory.</body>
