	<body>I start being condescending, and recognizing that although I have bored me almost from the min. 1 film, feminists, as a general rule, from 6 up to 99 years, who have entered the room, leaving their adult side out, have enjoyed almost as much as a "pig in a quagmire," for my part, I have no other choice that yawning, half asleep, and endure, time and peak that lasts this new animation Christmas Disney.Admito that both swath (between the actors and their animated counterparts there is a similar care) and the Alan Menken score, has been how little that I liked the tape; where, or shines Susan Sarandon (appears so little on screen that you almost forget to be part of the cast), Patrick Dempsey, James Marsden and Timothy Spal, as always (these last 2, up in the soup to see them), perhaps, would save the freshness of Amy Adams, perfect in his role as stupid and bobalicona Disney Princess, as well as the Nice digital squirrel, and that is where, in Disney films, special effects, although care, the order of the day.I imagine that Disney, seeing as well that has worked the film at the box office (where 50% are companions consorts.), will be a sequel, a line of toys and 150,000 merchandising products, and is that, otherwise not, but in the House of Mickey Mouse, sell the movies is the best they can do.On the other hand, I love watching as the city of New York, once again (well sell the city, cohones!) becomes a character more than the film, why not take example elsewhere in the world?Finally, they will enjoy, us aguantaremos, and we will have another tape which talk about Christmas right?</body>
