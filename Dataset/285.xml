	<body>I like the French cinema. Perhaps because it is one of the few with enough efugios to avoid being victimized by Hollywood. When Americans try to copar their billboards, instead of kicking and blame the State for their lack of ability to tune with the spectators, they are dedicated to making good movies. And why continue to arrive, one after another, great productions of our neighbours not always appreciated. The secret of Anthony Zimmer chronicles the life of a scammer who pursues the police of half the world but whose physical appearance nobody knows. In this hard struggle for the hunting of fearless offenders, a such Akerman has the advantage of knowing that our protagonist would do anything to return to see the beautiful Chiara. But the seasoned thief, connoisseur of the intentions of the detective hunting him through his muse, convinces her to deal with a stranger on the street, and to convince Akerman it's prey. The chosen will be François, who is immediately fascinated by the beauty of the young girl, without be able to imagine that it is only a tool in the service of the ignoto Zimmer. Sophie Marceau, a few months to comply with the 40, is still a beauty full of talent, a luxury for the Viewer, while the rest of the cast is shown correct. Balanced and measured, without stridence or fanfare, development contribute to give the film a harmonious and pleasant Cadence. A success undoubtedly this debut in the direction of Jerome Salle, which on their own merits earned last year nomination for best opera prima in the César awards for French film award which finally fell in the magnificent work "The nightmare of Darwin", Hubert Sauper.</body>
