	<body>Many days I've been criticizing Alberto San Juan, for being an actor that does much of its part to promote films made in various interviews that have done you, but I have to admit that criticism disappear in my mouth as soon as yesterday I saw this wonderful film, in which he plays one of the best roles of his life, along with the hours of light. ´Bajo the stars is an ode to the second chance we all renew our lives, when by the circumstances, have had to make decisions against our will. In the case of Alberto San Juan, she plays a trumpet player who had to go in Estella (Navarra) to pursue his career as a musician in Madrid. The death of his father, makes it back to the people and revive all that childhood so hard that he had to support his brother.In addition, some magnificent interpretations of Alberto San Juan, Julián Villagrán y Emma Suárez, we find a beautiful story that is told in a close manner and whose photograph is worth seeing, reminding far Obaba, along with this, the most significant of the film are the relationships that are established between each of the characters, focusing on Alberto San Juanalmost appears in every scene.Notably, this wonderful musical interpretation of Enrique Morente singing the main theme of the film to the Raphael with Aquarius and truth, I stay with the name of this director, Felix Viscarret, because I think it will give much to talk about and that his peculiar style will be worth seeing in the movies that he intends.</body>
