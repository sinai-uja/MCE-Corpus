	<body>First of all, I declare me the books of Harry and Potter fan. Of his films I am somewhat less fan, although I bought the pack of DVDs with the first three. And that shame to buy them, who told me those sold them only in the section of children, who were not adult movies. Because ale, I am glad, that also came me cheaper than Star Wars.La film is about a kid who is left in a House by a group of strange wizards when it is nothing more than a baby. Twelve years later, the kid has grown and his situation in life has worsened considerably. He lives under the stairs in the House of his uncles, which hate you and it is continuously persecuted by his unpleasant cousin. But this situation has changed the day that receives a strange letter from a school for wizards.The first of the Harry Potter saga introduces us to the characters in the story in a gradual way and nothing forced. It has a pretty child script, which does not mean it's not interesting. The atmosphere that creates the truth is that I love, given that everything is surrounded by a magical touch us like adults with children's tastes. Then the characters are very accomplished, and small not give too del cante.In short, the movie I liked. It is not a wonder of wonders, but since then it has much charm. Perhaps the end is a little weird, but we're going to do.Infantiloide, but can be seen very well.Besitos.P.D: The magical worlds that create certain writers should be subsidized by the Estado.P.D.2: I want to be Hogarts! I agree with Ron, I do not ask for much more. Although Hagrid nor me unwelcome.</body>
