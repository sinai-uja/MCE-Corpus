	<body>French Alexande Aja that recently signed with mastery the remake of the hills have eyes, it debuted in style with this film where to get as to time not be he witnessed long with a horror film. Anguish from the brutal appearance of the psychopath in question until a final stretch where the tension is more and not less as usual. All this supported by mechanisms of the 80s, where raw that dirty atmosphere where uncompromising face of the gallery we are witnessing a struggle to survive fierce fills with blood sweat and tears. Unfortunately the final surprise totally little credible and Manichean ends up breaking many virtues of an impeccable exercise of pure horror. Recommended anyway. A 7.</body>
