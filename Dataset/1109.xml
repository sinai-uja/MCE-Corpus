	<body>It is terrible to see a movie you like and not having anything to not reveal too much. That happens to me with 'The Prestige', the brand new film by Christopher Nolan, which adapted the novel of the same name by Christopher Priest. A treatise on obsessions that move and even can endanger lives, but also a great foray into the world of magic and mechanisms, psychological and physical, that handles. And also, a reflection on the art of entertaining and his ultimate goal, condensed in one sentence, which I am not going to reveal.Very convincing Jackman and Bale, excellent Michael Caine, Andy Serkiss and David Bowie, and Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo reduced to little more than mere comparsas by the argument, but with some scenes of showcasing (special mention at the time bra of Scarlett Johansson, in which I seem to remember that also passed something in the film).Tremendous photography (Wally Pfister) and the art direction (Nathan Crowley &amp; Kevin Kavanaugh), at the service of storytelling and not contrary, as in other cases.Only fat failure as a trend to the sobreexplicaci√≥n that is beginning to be pandemic in world cinema, in my view, clear. That and some are confused and are created that the important thing in this magic trick is to discover more than enjoy it. A 8'5.</body>
