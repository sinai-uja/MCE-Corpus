	<body>Wrong begins with a film if one has the feeling of something already seen five minutes around him on the head. A good old dog, cinematically speaking, is able to smell the unpleasant feeling even with only read a small synopsis of the story. And the truth is that Tuya Siempre, which means return to the cinema of Manuel Lombardero ten years after in arms of the Madura women, is an example that perfectly illustrates our theory.It is a story that portrays the low-life of a Spanish city in the mid-1980s. Lola (Flora Martinez) and Alfredo (Rubén Ochandiano) are a couple to survive carrying out small thefts. When the police arrested Alfredo, he meets Caesar (Andrés Gertrúdix), who grateful for help in the cell gets him a job at a local jazz Lola. In this local meet a large number of disturbing characters, such as Horacio (Nancho Novo) or Manuel Gay (Jose Coronado). The main fault of Tuya Siempre is the lack of originality and freshness of its history. The script falls on many topics, and the film is full of situations already very tired. However, the film is well armed, has a solid packaging, and has some good moments, as if they were small oasis for smart viewers.The bright picture of José Luis Alcaine, which gives the film of the texture indicated to his history and his music deserves a special mention. Best of Tuya Siempre are interpretations of a brilliant cast which include Flora Martínez, Nancho Novo (rather than deserved its award in Malaga) and José Coronado.</body>
