	<body>Meets, there is no a better word with which one can define the plot, the note, and the tape reportedly meets what intended, is not otherwise entertain, complies with the simplicity of the characters (some are seen coming from the first minutes of footage), meets the argument (simple, perhaps debtor tape as "Street dogs" and "Street dogs")(all films of the Torete and the Heifer and even this film cañí taste that we saw in the 1980s).Both Natalia Verbeke, as Daniel Guzman met with their respective roles and is in 1: 45 min. (including credits) can not ask for more than what the tape gives us, meets, and little else.By the way, a couple of scenes out streets of my neighborhood, Aluche.</body>
