	<body>Director: Gary Winick. duration: 100 minutes.Release date: April 27, 2007.Espectadores: 156.102 of human beings.The use of animals in the movies, especially in roles protagonists always is a little tiresome. Not even the great Babe (film that keeps a huge like this) prevent that more than one rechinen you teeth in the armchair when he sees parlar animals. Personally, although they entertained me these films, I finished call see working animals in the film. My own things.The film is about a girl who saves a small pig of a shaving of axe at the height of the neck. Send this to the farm of his uncle, where he became very quickly (the pig, not the girl) friend of all animals that are there, especially a spider named Charlotte. This makes every effort to save the life of the child, which has its days numbered, showing us how pretty that is friendship. That tender.On the basis that is a film for children, because it seems a nice film. It has a moral ending not see clear, but that leaves a good taste in mouth. Many moments of humor, basically given by the rat and the Ravens (who reminded me many great Tip and Coll), and moments of tenderness for a film for children of the House. My little liked much see as many animals together, though of course not the movie has swallowed it whole.In short, film about a spider that weaves to save the life of a small pig. For the public more often, is a nice history of animals and friendship, which surely will please kids. To me has seemed good, but too sentimentaloide.The end is long, and a tad firecracker, why not say it.kisses.</body>
