	<body>It goes without saying that I have always felt a strange fascination for James Bond. This twentieth first film of the adventures of the most famous secret agent of the world corresponds with the first novel published in 1953 by Ian Flemming, so we have here the first great work of the writers, which is the adapt the action, the technological means and language of more than fifty years to the present day. This installment has the great incentive to see for the first time the new protagonist, Daniel Craig, is the seventh actor to portray 007 and the first rubio, something which aroused the suspicions of many traditionalists, among whom I include myself. The sudden decision of Brosnan (previous shell) abandon the role, plunged producer in a serious problem, since he had been instrumental in the resurgence of the character, in a latent state since that Timothy Dalton play it for the last time in 1989. It is to be difficult in the times defending the role of a type that has no scruples when it comes to kill, drinks too much, smokes and uses women as mere objects. It is a brave gamble, and it seems that they have returned to hit with Craig and there who cataloged it as the best Bond since Connery. It seems to me, honestly, that lacks mordant and style, although interpretive level is quite well. The new Bond girl Eva Green French, still lacks a boil and Judi Dench is correct in his role of M, the strict head. Otherwise, the usual online: fast-paced action, bad very bad and special effects everywhere. Perhaps the words that best define vibrant and entertaining. But of course, this is matter of taste.</body>
