	<summary>Shrek the third, or how fuck a saga.</summary>
	<body>This weekend I had the opportunity to watch a movie at the end to which wanted: Shrek the third, third of the trilogy which started brilliantly and in its second part was surprised with some outstanding new characters as a puss in boots exceptional folding with much grace by Antonio Banderas. However the third had never lead to film, and is a clear example of that for many technical efforts there of by means, the screenplay for a film is everything. The story of Shrek the third returns to take the stories of a lifetime to intersperse his characters in the argument, but on this occasion the side entering scene - almost all the tales of our childhood Portas - do not provide anything too interesting, and what is worse, not too helpful in the development of a story which seems to be an attempt to loop the loop of the first two parts. Shrek is so well managed that it sometimes seems that an actor behind which had just then modified with the editing program had: sense of animation is almost lost in some moments, and even donkey or Puss in boots get save with their jokes (rather poor) a script that is really sad. So much so that I finished not even see it, and this is something that a film of this size should have failed. I already talked in the past the Spanish animation and of how a much-publicized film then in the news (the pathetic "El sue√±o de una noche de San Juan") showed that good it team - and that movie was also very poor in execution - without a script you have nothing. They should have left quiet Shrek. Equal to that Neo and the fabulous Matrix, whose second and third parties ever had have existed.</body>
