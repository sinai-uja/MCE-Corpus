	<summary>The film seems a waste of beauty, hardness and good performances, which, I would say without embarrassment, time is the very best I've seen in this year 2006.</summary>
	<body>I started reading the book almost trial, since he didn't arrive at the premiere of the film with the ass in the air, and is that always liked and leave the film and say that hackneyed phrase of "I liked more the book", and it is that though the novel painted me as the greater truño that has been able to write in years, to my seemed amazing, almost more entertaining that any best-seller of rapid consumption (not quote none to prevent sensitivities and not be labeled cultureta gafapastil), and he was already reading imagining his transfer to the screen, to make matters worse evils in the press of "The Prestige" pass behind had a couple of critics who praised the virtues of the film that brings us, so my bias could not be better.And this has been, the film seems a waste of beauty, hardness and good performances, which, I will say without embarrassment, time is the very best I've seen in this year 2006 which is left with barely a month to close, Tom Tykwer consists a solid group of players, where the more weight could be in the film (Hoffman and Rickman) passed as mere side and those that we should forget cling strongly to our consciencesBen Whishaw makes incredibly credible character Grenouille marking with an incredible tempo his moments of lucidity with the most absolute and dark moments of dementia, and Rachel Hurd-Wood that I already love being just a baby in "Peter Pan" by P.J. Hogan, returns to fill the screen with its incomparable beauty and character of Laura is the best of the film.Custom in my what to read criticism for taking the pulse of "general feeling", it has struck me deeply what for who has torn the garments before one of the scenes the film summits, of the orgiastic presence of Grenouille in Grasse, in the book, this scene is told in detailboth Patrick Süskind is possible with their words, while on screen passes from being a mere anecdote in the footage, not us we rasguemos vestments as soon, by God! (Never better said).Lack a chapter of the book, a part or something really important that broaden much more in the obsession of Grenouille, and is that this lack of smell is important in the plot, and here that happens almost on tiptoe, and is changed on the agenda of what happens, do perhaps by the time of footage? We coming thanks to the DVD to an extended version of the book?Finally, at the end of the film, he agreed in taste with all those we enjoyed the novel, and in disgust with those who have not lost a daily half-hour in taste her, here I leave the crux of the matter.</body>
