	<summary>Taken to chacota, it entertains. Lost in unrecoverable moments of bleak tedium. It has its place in the heart of the movie buff fact to, from time to time, take you the hair with so much grace and willingness.</summary>
	<body>Slightly escorada to the way in which Peter Greenaway understands the film, Tristram Shandy (A cock and bull story) not salpimenta its formal daring with continuous absurd, with regressions of the logic and unusual narrative corkscrews. The film is looked for in others and returns, proud, to his dramatic inconvenience to certain space culturalist between the satirical and placidly humorous, between the well contrivance irreverence and the disregard for content and make a round product.Michael Winterbottom comes a classic of the English novel with a reputation of being virtually untranslatable to the cinematographic language (the life and opinions of Tristram Shandy, Laurence Sterne), but not one avenible summary pattern of orthodoxy but agile and viperous decantation of the encyclopedic spirit, reforming the original towards a fragmentation imposed, embebecida film, modern historymetalingual, where the festive turmoil and, above all, a confesable celebration of language, since plot sustainable and archetypal almost there.Boring at the beginning, when we have the recording of the film serves as a leivmotiv of the film that we are witnessing, awakens when Winterbottom stumbles happily with the ins and outs, with the pure bambalina of actors that make actors. And here the film astonished, that does not mean that within the astonishment we atisbemos quality or joy. This young and already tanning filmmaker in some outstanding battles freak (Wonderland, code 46, 24 hour party people, road to Guant√°namo or nine songs) works better as a dessert light and greedy, as less than as a first dish divertimento because it tastes with mocking complacency, knowing the difficulty of commitment and giving self-indulgent winks to the harmless nature of the product.The legitimate's wishes mix classical drama and speech metadiscursivo, let me the reader coining this excessive semantic claim, produce humor (there is, dear reader, there is in abundance, although not always hilarious and hilarious) and even criticism within the film into the film itself (first hilada with the last scene).Too bad that is not always understood and some spectators, among those who do not want to include me, the ninguneen because of its apparent (perhaps true) chaos. I do not know at all the original text, have enjoyed his first adaptation to the screen.</body>
