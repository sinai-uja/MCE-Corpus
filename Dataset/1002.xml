	<summary>An entertaining comedy and little else to see a Sunday afternoon</summary>
	<body>Zoom tells us the story of Jack Shepard, aka Captain Zoom, superhero who lost his powers and currently living in oblivion. The arrival of a threat to the Earth will be for the Government agency that deals with these issues to go to him so you train a group of young people with powers to combat this threat.Zoom is a family comedy, with all that that implies, i.e. script loose and predictable jokes not exits of tone, love story of means and a topical outcome. The grace is that the protagonists are young people with superpowers, a special effects-laden production and a few winks geeks. The film also gets flying lasts little more than eighty minutes and note his prologue in the form of comics drawings explaining the history from which we left in the film.Tim Allen stars in the tape next to an aging Chevy Chase, making doctor in charge of the project, a role quite funny and ridiculous, but without a doubt the best role is that of Courteney Cox in the skin of a scientific lover of comics with the most geek. Of the tiny group of four children without a doubt the most funny is the little girl with Super strength and which caused most of the gags due to its power.An entertaining comedy and little else to see a Sunday afternoon.</body>
