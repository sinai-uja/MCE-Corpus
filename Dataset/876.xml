	<body>We have one film who say that Tom Tykwer is headed by and this may really be so until that happens more or less an hour and a half and is something that I will comment on later. The truth is that nosé if going to the cinema to 1625 or by the suckling pig of the film I was a little fried during the movie, and it is the only explanation given that this man becomes crazy is that it smells more than normal.The principle is good, and did foresee something more, what approach to objects that is sniffing, or about childbirth, is pretty well. Then the boy begins to find life and start the suckling pig, it loads the first girl by mistake, trying to it not yell, but hey as you cannot be so beast, finally. More later joins the decorative or perfumer anyway, they flip and prepares 100 perfumes come and more. Gets a cat where are the oils for perfumes, madremía.There is nothing interesting, until it comes to Monty Python, and is the orgy scene should be the last work of the English, because it can not stop laughing, with the initial astonishment logical, the most ridiculous form of conquer the town, the father of the dead girl, and even the priest, hehe, and when waking up, which descojone, but of the entire room eh!, I ask that if someone saw it in the cinema I comment out if people laughed or not, because in my room was tremendous. A man in front said "but good, this is incredible, this is unforgivable," but is that so absurd that was.Peorcito, those who have read the book say, they do not explain many things which are vital for understanding the poor protagonist, of always, the case is that the adaptation to the big screen is the worst.</body>
