	<summary>The script tries to be nice and enjoyable, but only manages to sink. It is not worth or take it out of the video-club.</summary>
	<body>Better known as "Trust the Man" ("believe the man"), one title rather more in line with the movie that this translation. "They and them". Let's start: what are the highlights of this film (something loose, everything must be said)?Julianne Moore (that it is time to give him a damn Oscar) and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who stays in mere anecdote next to Moore (which, incidentally, only participates in this film which is headed by her husband.).In addition to Moore and Miaggie. What's left us? A side staff who carry out their duties without stridency (not is no compliment), an insipid and bland address (go eye has Moore choice husband.) and. The script, the great guilty that the. PEL. ícula. (bufff, has cost me but I've said it) to stay in a stupidity of the size of a temple.The main mistake of the script is that it tries to be funny. I repeat: he tries, but fails. The most get is not be boring.But clear, trying to be nice and entertaining, manages to only sink (and quite muddy waters, everything is said) in a clump of clichés and (non-credible) forced and incredible situations.It is not worth or take it out of the video-club.</body>
