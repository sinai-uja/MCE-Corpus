	<body>Winning the prize for Best Director at the last festival Sundance (Catherine Hardwicke) and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised, the movie begins, less more and goes up slowly and gradually. I do not understand the mania of the "americanitos of a foot" for being "the most popular" damn I when I went to class it was simpler than a pot at school and not passing anything anyway. I return to where I was, after this small thinking aloud, the work of the actors has seemed sensational, highlighting a Holly Hunter in State of grace!FUCKING GREAT! (come on) and a history (based on a real event, the experiences of the writer, who plays the role of Evie Zamora on the tape) solid and seamless. Also I liked the soundtrack, although for my taste it was a tad strident and had times that did not understand a shit of what spoke. (and that have seen it in you) go, heard more noise than voices. You have called me attention, come another reflection (joer I am sembrao at this time) that when I was 13 years old not was thinking or in messing, nor in liar I, nor in smoking, nor in smoking dope, or in nothing of the sort. but I spent the day doing the jerk, playing football in my district, "plates", in the pool in the summer making the gili and little else. !!Joer that grow the kids today! I have to watch my niece that the remains a year to fall into such fatidica age. Anyway, the movie I loved and found me sobervia, one of those large tapes that certainly we should not miss.</body>
