	<summary>A tape, which, although excellently well set and with a development quite good (and short, I do not forget), ends with a very bad close. Often suckling pig without rhyme or reason...</summary>
	<body>Lately the lack of ideas in Hollywood let me quite haunted, to start an article in a magazine released the saga "to all gas", also in this way appeared on screens the film "on the edge of the waves", as well, this film that brings us today comes to root of a phone call, Yes, but a call, neither more nor lessa "ring" what? who is? And Zas! Film singing.A tape, which, although excellently well set with a development quite good (and short, I do not forget), ends with a very bad closure and is the film star Robin Williams, Toni Collete and Sandra Oh, does not know to lead us to the end where should do so, because its simple point and end does harm to the promising of the story beginning; a dramatic tragedy of those who we can see any day on a TV channel (on the desktop, of course).Perhaps, the problem that I see her at the tape, is that the narrative pace, infamous, trying to, in small doses, badly managed, put all eggs in one basket, and leave (with small traps) that the viewer has a lime and sand in the esasos other 75 min. footage (this that lasts 90 min. will be with the credits), of a shelve "simple" give terminate the projection.In short, I'll take a sentence that said one of the people who accompanied me on the pass: often suckling pig without rhyme or reason.</body>
