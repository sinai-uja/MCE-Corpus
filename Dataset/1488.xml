	<body>Carries this movie on the shelf within the pack "Stanley Kubrick" not less than five years, but he encouraged me not to see her. The poster the truth that is not very interesting, until he told me my medium Zucchini that was laughing. So with that premise, and given that my career as film critic must be truffled reference to archaic films, me I started to see it with the baby, who will learn dialogues from memory.The film is about a high command of the army, who decides to declare nuclear war the Russians. This launches a signal to all aircraft that have weapons of this type, what compels them to launch their burden on Soviet strategic locations. Locked is based the high command, together with an intermediate charge is to avoid the disaster. On the other hand, the President of the United States Government meets his advisors to resolve the situation, having to deal with the Russian Ambassador and even the President himself.To me the old humor movies tend me to be very childish and I don't finish like. But this has nothing to do, humor that uses is very clever to absurdity. But not only is a tape of humor, if not that shows something very real and alarmantel, how easy that might destroy the world. Just a series of coincidences and raise all mauve. Highly recommended, given that it has not lost too much current, have only changed the "actors" that dominate us.In short, tremendous peliculón of humor and criticism to be rie a historical very critical moment in the history of mankind as it was the cold war. Highly recommended for everyone, especially for those who govern us.</body>
