	<summary>New tape by the visionary Zemeckis that even caring for the animation to unexpected places, finally leaves the audience plunged into a very strange feeling as the story told.</summary>
	<body>For my Robert Zemeckis is a visionary, and is that what Julio Verne has always managed to go a step ahead in this film, to begin with, in the 1980s was bag Pocket travel in time with the excellent "Back to the future" series, then made live humans with cartoons (now see humans in the film coexisting with CGI)in "Who framed Roger Rabbit?" years but later I reflected the loneliness that recently we have seen will Smith in "I am Legend" in his "Castaway" with Tom Hanks, and three years ago (seems to have been yesterday) was pulled out of the manga a technique for filmmaking, using the motion capture that seems to be the future of cinema as we know it todayas graphically imposed, although it is still in its infancy, and has the wonder of shorten shootings in a surprising way, and is everything is added later, in the room of postproduction, and who gave their first blows with "The Polar Express" and that now, with this film that brings us, it seems that little by little they have improved the technique.In this case they have gone over the film in question has been released in 2 ways, both conventional and 3D, curiously all the criticisms and views that I have heard about people who loved them the tape has been by that have seen in 3D, in my case it is not the case, and the conventional way has been to which I have referredtaking a strange reaction and a bittersweet recap.And it is that, "Beowulf" tape regulate where they exist, despite having a roster of those that would delight, first any director, and after any film lover, features not only the voices (typical in a tape of animation) but with the faces of Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie (you can see "pseudodesnuda"), John MalkovichRobin Wright, Alison Lohman, and Ray Winstone, who thanks to the motion capture becomes a young "pipiolo" slob, when he already has about 50 springs.It is true that a tape of this type, action, fantasy, epic; any of the 3 previous qualifiers I worth, one might not expect much more than it is, and not to deceive, or RIP vestments, nor, much less take the hands to the head, if at any time, the result is desired, that the tape it, based on an eponymous Anglo-Saxon epic poem, which was written in old English alliterative verse. 3.182 Verses, it contains much more material than any similar work in your language, and represents approximately 10 per cent of the existing corpus of Anglo-Saxon verse, which do not say I, but wikipedia, to know an egg.And that has been, not only the base, but also the guts and the backbone of a hundred stories, legends and even films (there have Fables as Conan, and even stories of Tolkien and other many writers.), so I don't can be surprised at all that he knows what is going to find at all times, andthough the animation is careful, excellent (much better than in "The Polar Express") and takes you back to those dark times, the film fails to convince all and ends leaving the viewer with a curious sense of apathy and not have come to be 100% in line with the same.</body>
