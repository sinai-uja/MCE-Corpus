	<summary>Estimable's first feature film Jaime Marques. Good first film of James Marquis, which starts strong in the Spanish scene. We will continue his career, it seems much deserve the penalty.</summary>
	<body>Sober first film in the film of James Marquis Olarreaga, very serious in their approach, not complacent with the viewer and an unconventional narrative which won the special jury prize at the last Festival of Málaga. Marquis Spanish film dominates the art of script, managing to capture a hard, sad, in a very personal way violent, history of search for identity of a lonely person who tries to achieve dream: find her mother and, I say, to live with her happy the rest of its existence.Along the way you realize, if that did not know already, that life is a jungle where nobody gives anything for nothing and where each one them it should be understood as possible to survive.Few but good dialogues, excellent performances, with a, again after "Cabeza de perro", Juan José Ballesta content and a Maria Valverde that fills the screen with his special face. Concise narration that constantly plays with light and spaces, as well as the sound and music.All of this makes "Thieves" is as a very, very serious work, away than usual in Spanish film, which does not have downs or pace or dramatic intensity, going with ease of amusing sketches of manners and the sparkling dialogues between the two protagonists, certainly foreseeable end but no less forceful.This not subtract interest to this good first film of James Marquis, which starts strong in the Spanish scene. We will continue his career, it seems much deserve the penalty.</body>
