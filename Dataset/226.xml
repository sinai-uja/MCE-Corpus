	<body>Between superheroes, serial killers and beings "romanticotes" who came across the Atlantic usually strain, very occasionally, a title branded "indie". This tends to be the most commonly used Word with a view to the promotion of Thumbsucker, as if this will be a sign of prestige. The use of the independent label sometimes gives result, otherwise coletillas as "the Sundance hit" or "the surprise of the Berlinale" are added.

We do not forget to Keanu Reaves, who has a brief intervention.As throughout history with alternative label, with careful soundtrack, actors and simple wrapper, Thumbsucker aims high, including the label of "did not expect such an impact". Remember a Beautiful girls although its characters are closest with everything for a dream, the roles of Matt Dillon, Nicole Kidman and Joaquin Phoenix, characters in their daily life are brought to the limit. Lou Taylor Pucci, silver bear for best actor in Berlin, has the gift of naturalness, with scary face and accepting the role of second which will soon give the surprise, a be poorly versed in the arts of communication that will change while approaching the end of this comedy different which allows you to leave the cinema with a smilerather light by the drama that hides because, friends, grow and become adult is not an easy task.</body>
