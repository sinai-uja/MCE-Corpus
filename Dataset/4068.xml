	<body>This is one of those movies is I still pending to see and hopefully had not seen because its screening has proven to be an absolute torpor without limits.Jodie Foster we have come lately to the jumbles and this film passes to complete its list of películas-basura, whose scripts we accept players when there are no better else to do and the end of the month we drowns.The almost non-existent script, overwhelms us with a whole series of inconsistencies and stupid things worthy of a film series Z.La film is totally absurd, boring until the madness with a stinky cast, are going is that neither the soundtrack, osea, nothing, a real pretentious and meaningless garbage.It is incredible that a girl lost in an aircraft but less credible still is the development of the events. What thought the writers for God's sake?I said, nothing advisable.</body>
