	<body>The other day at lunch he revisionaba (Yes, I have a tape of 4 hours on LP with a lot of programs) of NST (night without truce) and I found that Malena arteriovenous and the Director of this film that brings us today, Agnes Paris, had been invited to one of them at the time of its release in theaters.The truth is that had had the opportunity of seeing the film in a press pass, but they finally and for reasons I do not come to the case, not I went to the same, and nor I had the slightest interest or the slightest concern towards the film, until I saw pictures on this programme and the interview of rigour than the illustrious Matthew Dani made them.Said Ines Paris, perhaps, the tape would both convince to youth, which would be that they ended up reading both Cervantes and Shakespeare. Sincerely Ines with hand on heart and all the possible sincerity that fits in my stubborn calva, if to read Shakespeare (which I have read more than D.Miguel, and it is that in fact the Quixote so I have not read, or think do) need movies like this. I turned off and vamonos; now I am in charge I take the key and throw it to the farthest possible River.And is that the film, starring Elena Anaya, Juan Luis Galiardo, Wil Kemp and Malena Alterio and Jos√© Pou, is nothing more than a farce of those that years film to they interpreted in the corrales, corralas or as God so call yesteryear (now theatres), and is, my lady, is needed more packaging than a pair of farts, burping, cacas, ass and 4 jokes, even appearing in tapes of Pajares, Esteso and Ozores.En some bars of the film I have had the same feeling when I saw those of Asterix, and the script we showed as such or which thing had been "guilt" of these Gallic geniuses; as well, in "Miguel y William" there are continuous references Cross (and, at the same time invented) about the life of both and as ideas of one or the other they are carried works of Cervantes or Shakespeare, that okay, understand that they are "tricks" of the writer, but arrive tired, by his excessive repetition.Did not want to end without stress or beat, the performances of performers, that I always say with the ubiquitous (and in the interpretiva plot), and is that, perhaps I stay alone with Will Kemp, very nice as Shakespeare, Helena Anaya (is this girl got me cattle with those eyes has.), Juan Luis Galiardo as a "viejuno" Cervantes andon all arteriovenous Malena, which I had used to seeing her in his comic vis and as "good" and here is the villain of the function; It's nice to see her in another plot.On the costume, I think horrendous, while highlighted the costumes for "Teresa in the body of Christ", here, seems worthy of Agatha Ruiz de la prada, in this case the costume designer Sonia Grande makes the canelo in clothes that are the protagonists, and "emperifolla", Helena Anaya, and Malena arteriovenous and leaves with some sad and horrendous robes to the rest, as wanting to give interest to female characters, wasted by the script, especially in that resident machismo in the middle ages.In short, an experiment is simple, and stupidly mundane (and boring) comicamente.</body>
