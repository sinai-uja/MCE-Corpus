	<body>This film is already another story and what we have here is a pure and hard and outdated more comedy. A young man returns to his hometown in Australia after suffering a childhood trauma and panic now an excessive and irrational sheep. He travels to sell his share of the farm to his brother, who has been with the family business after his father's death. Brother intends to develop a new kind of sheep through experience genetic, but something just coming evil and an epidemic that turns to both them sheep in violent killer is seizing the town.Totally crazy, wild and surreal comedy full of crappy special effects and blood to navigate and with some hilarious characters, attention to the herbs which aims to solve everything based on natural remedies. A small downturn in rhythm is inevitable in the second half of the film, before the final Savage, but it is an understandable and salvageable bug. I personally enjoyed much more and I have more fun with this film than with the previous. To you have fun and a laugh.</body>
