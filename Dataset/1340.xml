	<body>Cojase a good list of blockbuster films (beginning by "code Da Vinci", following by "Snakes on a plane", "X-Men", "Charlie and the chocolate factory," "Saw", "Supernacho", "The Chronicles of Narnia", some television programs made in USA, and even "Scarface", "Mission Impossible", "Superman Returns", the "Harry Potter", the adventures of "Pirates of the Caribbean", "Click" and even "Borat" which in the end have gotten shoehorn)(even some strokes of "Last lap", "Star Wars" and the new adventures of "007").The best of these films is that the ambiance, makeup and sets calcan exactly to the original film, the rest, the simple, sad and forgettable that I have seen in a long time.Sharing highlight the presence of Carmen Electra, Jennifer Coolidge (the famous mother of Stifler's "American Pie", David Carradine cameo, and Kal Penn, who took part in one of the films parodied ("Superman").)In the end, little more than highlight.</body>
