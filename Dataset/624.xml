	<body>Calmly, so takes it the first third of 13 Tzameti Géla Babluani first feature film footage, until it enters the same hell.The movie plays in the same league as Calvaire, for instance recent and criticisms that can be seen in the poster are a bit exaggerated, but it is very good. Sébastien is a looser that earn the living fixing roofs and while he arranged one on the coast, the owner of the House dies and Sébastien finds a letter that quoted the deceased in a place.Not (believe) nothing to lose, Sébastien moves towards this place. There is also a touch Haneke in the film, but above all, much classicism and a great and noir band sound. <>could say that it is what Hostel could not have been, why the Eli Roth is a comedy and not. What I liked least was the end, with a little bit of usual suspects, Carlito´s way or Collateral, although it may also be due to my overheated imagination. Tariel Meliava great photography. A recommended movie. A 7.PD: that sad, everything remains the same. If poneis Tzameti on imdb you will appear on the tab of the movie and also this: Untitled 13 (Tzameti) English Remake (2008) the imagination to power.</body>
