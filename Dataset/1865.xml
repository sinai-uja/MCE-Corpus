	<summary>Very interesting film of political gender, although it seems that he speaks of things past, is no doubt it has connotations of cutting today.</summary>
	<body>Rober de Niro is telling us the life (apparently based on one of the bosses of the CIA) of a man off, solo, sad aspect of an honored official going to theirs, without messing with anyone.Nothing more distant to the reality in some aspects but also close in others.Nearby on the sad and lonely, having placed to their homeland, uses, to his personal life, his family and friends. And distant because his life is full of violent events from the suicide of his father until the attempted invasion of Cuba at the Bay of pigs, to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro.De Niro achieves a good film, perhaps a bit long, but full of good times (very hard interrogation to the is false, true?) Valentin Mironov), with a clear narrative, great performances (Michel Gambon extraordinary and very well Anjelina Jolie, with only the look expressing all the pain and loneliness that dominates his empty life), and a use of lively Assembly that gets the Viewer to follow the story forward. Inter alia because de Niro gets good dose of intrigue, with this little clear recording that throughout the film they try unravel the members of the CIA."The technical aspect is impeccable, with a perfect ambientaciòn thanks to excellent work in the chapter of costumes and make-up and hairdressing.""The good Shepherd" requires that the viewer knows that it will be many minutes in the room watching this tape, but if you already know it, it will succeed in getting involved in a story that will no doubt fill you and leave satisfied.</body>
