	<summary>Being a documentary about Sigur r칩s already knew that it would be unstoppable musically. Not imagined what it cautivase with such force, achieve so much with so little.</summary>
	<body>Heima is the spectacular documentary signature Dean DeBlois (Lilo &amp; Stitch) on the Icelandic band Sigur r칩s, which during the year 2006 was to his native land to offer a series of free concerts without prior advertising.I worried about another documentary a bit sosote that really does not show me more than cool cockiness (going by the Oasis) series and horny, but finally and after cool cockiness, and I find myself with one of the most relaxing style exercises of recent times and some eager to mad to go to live there.Heima is not a follow-up to the use, a news story or a "documentary about a rock band" the feelings that emerge in a concert of the band are reflected in powerful images and a brutal beauty, a little "rebusc치" at the beginning but which gradually take over your fucking head, such as the memorable Von marked at Gamla Borg, time of absolute melancholic brilliance captained by that Orri on drums with a t-shirt on which we can read SADNESS.</body>
