	<body>While Rodriguez tape is excellent and seems to always cut on the same pattern, it hurts me to say that the Tarantino (however much liked at Cannes), seems really dull, vacuous and emptiness of his filmography and is that much to add a new lack of rolls, as well as an excellent home to us reconcila with 70s cinema and therefore with the "Black exploitation", and even autohomenajearse in some other time, with scenes, very tarantinianas.Lost in a tape with much dialogue and little, very little action, where even though put effort and filling it with good music (to my taste with Cameron Crowe are the best "bandasondistas" from the Hollywood scene), with another cameo of himself Quentin, and where in spite of repeated both McGowan and Marley Shelton in small roles fails to entertain the Viewer.Besides, the presence of Kurt Russell as villain has little, very little entity and it seems more like a poor man without any grace, that a "bad maloso" that give us and we generate something more than a proverbial sentence since their first min. on screen, and is the film above to take long to catch a little bit of rhythm.In short, the Tarantino of the Grindhouse segment loses strength every minute that passes, disappointed, certainly after the well that one passes in the tape of Rodriguez.</body>
