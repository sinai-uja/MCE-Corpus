	<body>Behind this title something simpleton and quite misguided hides a fairly casual English comedy, made as an homage and parody of the recent successes that have come to the cinema and dealing with Zombies, from the very bad "Resident Evil" until the exceptional "dawn of the dead", the tape, produced by "Working Title" is amazing and 100% recommended for lovers of movies from Zombies. Also with a fresh and fun, humor that drinks of British comedies, the only downside I can find is that things of English humor (quite acid) to be put quite some attention, since if not not he catches the grace there may be. Stresses in the soundtrack two Queen songs taking part in two of the film's funniest moments. And a finish that leaves you for a long time with laughter in the mouth. Sharing names of best current English comedians, quite unknown in Spain, that make all without exception a few completely casual roles. Another negative note is the title, as in original version is called "Shaund of the Dead" and here have entitled the poorly as "Zombies Party" which makes no sense with the film itself. Finally, a zombie film with another air and very but very funny.</body>
