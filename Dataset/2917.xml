	<body>Cube, Prime, Pi. all were science fiction movies. And unless the cube seemed it none. Sure that there is more. The cold hour comes after photos that someday I will try to see. At the moment I am not ready.Then he collaborated on the screenplay of absent, that it seems a lot (of bad, horrible, of typical) and think I'm going to detach me from Quiroga. With his penultimate movie (No-Do is in the oven) makes that I hook, which interests me and it bothers me. And you ask me some things.The good news is that the atmosphere of the works cited at the beginning has at times. The trouble is that it shows here more about the lack of resources. And it is more cheat.The main difference is found in the resolution and, indeed a cliché (or déjà vu, what more you mole. are you French?) present in several moments that should be key and are topicazos despite the way. Perhaps some "attack" should have been avoided, but at what price? If not samples some action I know of more than one who falls asleep. In the distribution (a couple at most) charismatic characters, actors with a bad day and too obvious filler characters.It still has good manners, take advantage of very little and has an interesting ending. But trickster. Very cheat. 6.5.</body>
