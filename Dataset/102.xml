	<summary>Adventure movie for kids quite entertaining</summary>
	<body>What first catches attention of Zathura is its similarity to Jumanji, which is not uncommon that this film supposed to be Jumanji 2 but when already failed the actors of the first part they decided to continue with the movie as if it were independent but still the Association is obvious, in fact the big difference between the two is that Jumanji possessed some history and this movie is rather a succession of adventures with a surprise ending which makes the movie rather improve.This time two brothers are left an afternoon alone at home by his father under the care of his teenage sister who sleeps only, in a match the small finds in the basement the Zathura game and convinces his brother to play. To their surprise home to start the game appears in the middle of the space where should continue playing facing aliens, meteorites and robots to go home and put aside their differences.ZATHURA is true kinship with children's films from my time in that sense rather appeals to nostalgia which could make it enjoyable with more adults however is mainly a film adventures for children and quite entertaining, even if the script is only an accumulation of episodes after others until the end where there is a discovery that puts the movie into perspective and gives some warmth and a messagesimple, but at the end and after message.</body>
