	<body>?This is the story of a cock and a bull. This is del toro of my father, the cock now is her teach?. So begins an irreverent comedy of Winterbottom who from the outset not call deception to those who believe that they will see an accurate adaptation of the book of Sterne.Porque to Tristram Shandy (A cock and bull story to)?Life and opinions of Tristram Shandy? It was inadaptable with its nine volumes and its long inner dialogues seen it coming. So Winterbottom makes his lib√©rrima version where the confessions and intimate thoughts of the character which give the film its name are unimportant, giving way to an excellent comedy film within the film.And the result is excellent. The film immerses us in the ups and downs of the filming of the adaptation where, in all, the dwarves begin to grow shortly after start. The rivalry between the leading actor - Steve Coogan - and the secondary candidate - Rob Brydon-provide the best moments of the movie with a few talks - between surrealism and Dada - which are really great, discussing from the height of their boots until the color of their teeth.Winterbottom - how non - it is slightly in excess of some situations - too eccentric - and performed tributes, winks, cinematic autosatisfacciones - or what you want call - every movie wig and crinoline who has been viewing and it liked, leaving a very comic/pedantic set. But note that making this film so it has been better than the make-up artist of 9 songs and that he knows of what he speaks, making an excellent exercise of criticism to me is seems autobiographical.But if something found me striking is that the director of 24 hour party people committing a sacrilege to me unforgivable. Jump to the Bullfighter an unwavering standard of cinema, include in the soundtrack emblematic items of other films! In particular: eight and a half (8 1/2) - Fellini-Barry Lyndon - Kubrick - and the draughtsman's contract - Peter Greenaway-. This touched me but it would listen to the book of Stern fans, that if any of Proust of these also must be plenty. That said, Winterbottom is a licentious.PS: Curious comment that the interview that supposedly makes Steve Coogan in the film is a real journalist of the New York Times who came to the filming for interviewing Winterbottom on 9 songs.</body>
