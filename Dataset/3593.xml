	<body>The unknown DAVID GEBROE apparently charm I ZOMBIE and DEAD CREATURES by ANDREW PARKINSON and he told to quickly copy to see if I get the original thing. Since then the idea of the development of the ZOMBIE phenomenon decanting is by the drama of a disease already did so much better PARKINSON, therefore it got much more humor with a relationship through something akin to deadly ZOMBIE one of the few decent films by YUZNA.The director with a very low budget which oscillates the amateur returns with the same actors in his opera prima, the horrific comedy THE HOMEBOY that unless they put desire and are highlights of general mediocrity.The film has fun of good humour, some well managed scare moments or certain GORES scenes well resolved but as a whole suffers from a certainly mediocre makeup with little force in the development of a story which improves the end to an attempt which had good spirit though it is disappointing and is that not everyone has the talent of Parkinson's that if he saw this film is rare to not put the cry in the sky after seeing their looted ideas.</body>
