	<summary>Simplistic tape of desktop, where neither the presence of Salma, nor our Pé, saves for the disaster film</summary>
	<body>I was not interested the slightest film, mention other than the promotional "auto-bombo" that her have been giving in countless media (promotion calling it now) and that makes you go to see her almost obliged, hoping and praying that stupid thus cessation of once and for all the heaviness that media submitted us.In honor of the truth, I will say that the final push towards the theater I it gave Salma Hayek and is that the curves of the beautiful Mexican help the more reluctant towards more distant planet film, just by seeing her swagger on screen.And after the excuse, that is not so, we go with the film; a simplistic tape of desktop, where neither the presence of Salma, nor our Pé, saves film of the disaster, suitable for television desktop, and sustained in the "girl-power" that such harmful results bearing on screen, tries to tape, not without certain doses of lack originality, take the Viewer to the garden, where Steve Zahn practiced vase man, pa' then say.It is curious, as a diarist tape, tries to exploit the cool side of Mexico and the villain of the "gringos", but if the film is shot in France! Lords distributors, producers and other elements whose position just in - you money, do not lose to the public their valuable time in these films. We are so welcome filling their coffers at the box office.</body>
