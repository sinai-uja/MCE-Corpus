	<body>Really I do not think that this is a film for submission to the Oscars, there were other options such as "Las 13 Rosas" that had done better paper, or at least I think. The orphanage flag after the noble name of "William de el Toro" and of course this fact in itself already sold. What we are faced with viewing however is a film that mixes various passages of horror movies already consummated in the success with addition too many similarities to "Others" of Alejandro Amenábar. at the level of production and implementation are dealing with a round film note here the hand of "del Toro" aesthetically thank God runs away from conventionalism and cutrerío widespread in Spanish filmsincreasingly we are beating faster.Unfortunately the argument has many inconsistencies, ** SPOILER ** as for example the fact that Simon is able to enter in the famous House of Thomas, dodging the iron pipes (that same mother then it costs work move) and crosses above the door empapelada without that there is not even the minimum tear the paper, then it is his own mother that rips the paper from the wall to lay bare the door secret. AH! and of course Simon does not have the knob of the door I mean that the thing is even more complicated. We are facing a child that passes through walls and doors? or do we have to assume that as a ghostly theme everything is possible? ** SPOILER ** in short, predictable film which expected much more perhaps by the expectations so high that they were created on it. Belén Rueda is the only thing that I liked the film.</body>
