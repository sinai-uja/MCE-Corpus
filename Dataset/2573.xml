	<body>Jindabyne is the place where coexist different strata making up the story, and which is dominated by the general level representing the serene evolution of the nature of that region, the arid fields, the waters of the lake or the mountains that surround the River. According to the visual approach of director Ray Lawrence, the natural landscape is the true protagonist of the story, seen through long flat and the contemplative Cadence whereby the eye of the camera immerses us in its geography, it almost looks respond to an ideal animist of return to nature, the same kind that holds varied human profiles. Thus, Jindabyne is not so much a film about the emotional or ideological conflict between human beings as an allegorical representation of nature in conflict with the artificial world and human culture, including. The level which opens the narrative - the nature of the landscape segment and limited by a thread of wire - expresses the conflict that will also have a correlative closure in the simple act of murdering an insect trapped in the interior of the truck, whose owner homicide will be the trigger for the crux of the story.In this way, Lawrence aims to weave a network of interconnected phenomena; connection between human beings, in a secondary stratum, and connection between humans, human culture and nature, in the main stratum, the most significant for narrative purposes it is which could encompass all the structure latent. The speech progresses while it addresses topics varied from angles opposite depending on what character is used to emphasize a certain aspect of the narrative: costumbrista story, coral melodrama, reflection on human feelings and choices that arise when extraordinary events interfere in daily life, social conventions and the problems arising from the Act of rape them, moral dilemmas because of conflicting beliefsEcology, racial motives and a long etcetera. An idea of masterpiece but that it does not have the necessary packing, primarily because the director, confused often subtle with the scattered and indefinite, and although it is likely that in the minds of Lawrence everything has a sense consistent with an idea of very clear basis, as it is developed on the screen, not collecting the required clarity. Subtlety is not use the silences to trot and moche or omit some aspects of the argument are key to organise the motivation and development of the characters properly. Subtle means ingenuity and versatility, and no such routine dialogues and a repetitive pattern of omissions and silences which ultimately tarnish the good intentions of the author: this entails the dispersion of the story and the final grey, with the consequent burden for narrative purposes.The corpse of a girl floating in the waters of the River refers to the interaction be human, often unpleasant and violent, incompatible, as seen in the tense representation of electrical towers that destroy the landscape, and fear raised in one of the protagonists of the tour, animist beliefs. The murderer, is precisely an electric company worker. In the end, all the characters meet in a field of beautiful nature, in an Aboriginal ceremony culminating with a love song in memory of the murdered (is so priceless capricious as the fact that the homicide is present at the ceremony), which becomes the basis of general reconciliation.Quite apart from all this, Jindabyne, although unsuccessful, is an interesting and recommended film for the movie buff, by the good intentions of the author and the attempt to create something that goes beyond the usual patterns. That Yes, everything becomes an attempt.</body>
