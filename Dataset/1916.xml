	<summary>It contains a couple of beautiful scenes thanks to elaborate special effects, but they succumb to general inconsistency, boredom, saturation, excess and the aggression of a thundering sound effects that just invite you to run.</summary>
	<body>Confusing, unconscionable, artificial, languid, noisy, bland, empty, failed, incongruous and absurd, with a few flat characters and an argument thrashed ajado, gnawed, re-read, revisto, remamado, conventional and no contributions or original ideas. Supposedly pretentious outside and merely badass inside. He could quietly pass by one of the bad and psychedelic trips of one of the protagonists of the great and so far away Trainpotting, but what really is, surely, is a pastiche without taste or criterion, nonsense, a waste of time and money for the unlucky ones who like me, see unfortunately attracted by the juggling and this unfortunate and disappointing film proposal colorines. It contains a couple of beautiful scenes thanks to elaborate special effects, but they succumb to general inconsistency, boredom, saturation, excess and the aggression of a thundering sound effects that just invite you to run.</body>
