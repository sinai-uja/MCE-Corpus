	<body>The powerful Warner Bros., brings us a talented hand of maestro Scorsese remake (spare all that can be said of this man, that the foundations of cinema is tottering with only mentioning his name already) and with a sensational cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, Jack Nicholson and Alec Baldwin. With both renowned of medium was frankly difficult shit her.Set in a "Mafia" of the old Boston time, infiltrators strengthens on our screens with considerable success. One of the best films of this unfortunate "cinematically" speaking 2006.El that was handsome Hollywood (Dicaprio) child is a versatile, demonstrating that if it is a star it is not only because of his physique, something which I'm deeply glad that this guy is a crack of the interpretation acting him despite who gets upset. Accompanied by a sensational Nicholson and Damon to rise to the occasion, create an exciting mafia triangle.In this film, the script takes prominence, thanks to William Monahan (the Kingdom of heaven). The verbiage that defend the characters comes to complicated to the extent that you have to take a breath to continue the dialogue (in VOS).Little or nothing is against infiltrators. Highly recommended even if you do not like the mafia film, it is worth seeing her and live this tension which was created and is maintained throughout the plot.</body>
