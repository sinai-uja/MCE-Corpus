	<summary>If you can avoid her, better than best.</summary>
	<body>Framed as a pilot episode of a series, or shot to DVD or Video, this monstrosity of Z series (why not you can be described as otherwise) has been sold as "The second part of Starship Troopers" the magnificent film by Paul Verhoeven in 1997 based on the novel "Brigades space" by Robert Heinlein. It should be noted that when in a 90% film develops in darkness or night is that shortcomings!And it certainly has! The script is predictable, non-existent special effects and also mixed films, from "Alien" until "The invasion of the ultracuerpos" to "Hidden" and perhaps trying to give some action in the fighting of the humans against the insects without success, given that the film is perhaps more horrifying that you can find. The only original cast appears an actress that was secondary in the first movie, nor is it to ask you too to the tape, that as I said navigates between several genres, action, horror. A film that if you can avoid, better than best.</body>
