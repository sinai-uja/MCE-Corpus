	<body>I read somewhere that someone believed that film of the 21st century will turn into this, and'm me afraid that this could be true because this is not cinema, are just a lot of special effects mixed with violence and video game aesthetics. I have nothing against special effects, on the contrary, they are very useful in certain movies to achieve a more realistic effect, but it should not be forgotten that special effects should be at the service of the story told, and the less they notice more good are, however, in 300 and some other current films, there is no storyWe only go to movies to see what well facts are the effects, and that's very sad, cinema must be something that excited, that makes you throb and stay glued to the Chair, that makes you feel emotions, and me 300 has left me completely indifferent, gave me like all the characters and what happens to them, and something fundamental in a film of truth is for the Viewer to get involved somehow in the historynow tell me someone if he has been implicated in the history of this film? 300 is a show empty and meaningless, with typical discourses on the honor, glory, and bla, bla, that anyone convinced already. A nice wrapper but with nothing more absolute in its interior.Many times I read the typical argument that "is pure entertainment and nothing else", and I wonder do people only you they entertain the bad movies?, I do not understand, me me entertains more see a good movie that makes me think and tell me something, rather than a simple and empty blockbuster season, will be that I am a bit rare.</body>
