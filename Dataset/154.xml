	<summary>The talent of Johnny Depp is makeup and wasted a unbearable character left</summary>
	<body>Freddy: I have No words to express how much I like this man. And do not believe that mine is same to dry, is that Johnny Depp is one of the best actors today, and the only ones that can bring forward with the CAP is a film that a priori might seem vulgar. If it is a bit Lord Byron, but shows very well, and is not the first nor the last makes it, the fall from the top of a true genius of poetry than it has been all for women (and men). But his return of twist is very appetizing, the truth. The Libertine has dialogs of those that make vibrate because more interpreted are recited with intensity. And in addition, immediately engages with a beginning (and end) directly involving the Viewer. After this performance, I mean, I'm looking forward to see, that I get the best Pirate Jack Sparrow. By the way, she, although little graced is a love.Jason: I totally disagree. We can not let ourselves be carried away by our passions personal when analyzing The libertine. Depp is one of the finest actors and with the broader records that move today through the cinema screens. However, and although it hurts to say it, in The Libertine his talent makeup is and in the hands of an unbearable character desperdiciado which Marquis de Sade low hours. And speaking of Sade, Quills that was a film in which actor, Geoffrey Rush, became the absolute protagonist. On that occasion, despite the simplistic theme, the result was acceptable. You can not say the same of The libertine. Here, even Depp can do something to bring forward a film doomed to failure since the first minute of footage, in which thing which never comes to fulfil promises. Fortunately, clear.</body>
