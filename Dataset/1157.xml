	<body>Cuts of my life going to a frenetic pace and has an amazing soundtrack. It never stops to make it clear if it is a comedy, but it has to be. Da laughter and luckily because but the melodramatic point would be unbearable. But he crushes the momentum make an easy joke and mockery of his characters; What is brave.It is the autobiographical account of the disenchantment of a child with his mother. Based on the memoirs of Augusten Burroughs which are already a bestseller. But Burrows has a rather passive role in its crazy youth. Child has the affection of his mother and happily shares his role. No recent his extravagance until that she abandons him at home in his psychoanalyst with a worthy case study psychiatric family. Just watch their dirty dealings in the kitchen makes one improve their self-esteem.Annette Bening plays the madre-diva with poet delirium. Therapy quite worsens you their situation. It falls into the hands of a psychiatrist that is worse with psychoanalysis and valium. Bening is magnificent and the neurosis only highlights its beauty.The cast is good which is important for all of the characters are somewhat peculiar. Here everyone planned their feelings and download his wrath; all the time. Sometimes things you will hand to the film and there are times rather forced. But it is a work of great value. The same Burrows or even cares about making a cameo appearance disguised simply appears at the end of the film to make a wink to the camera. Who knows sobrepasada therapy can vent you writing a novel, the film is perhaps a very sweet revenge. But must not deny you his moment in the light.</body>
