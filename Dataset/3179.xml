	<summary>The best Spanish horror movie in a long time. Live fear. The perfect mix between (spoiler!) The project of the Witch of Blair and 28 days later.</summary>
	<body>REC scares. Narrates a day's work in while you sleep (disturbing title for a show), show TV presents Angela Spain direct style and on this occasion it approaches the fire brigade of Barcelona, with whom will spend a night of guard accompanied by Paul and your camera principal witness to say the absolute protagonist, that camera and terror are live this history Portas.Entry the night received a call to attend the fall of an elderly woman, but what awaits there is fucking hell unleashed.Of course the film bears resemblance to the project of the witch, but only of the perspective. In that movie the characters know that walking involved and here Angela expected as much a pet rescue. Balagueró and Plaza join forces to create with style, great claw and total credibility.And like the witch project that has a climax a-T - E-R-R-A-D-O-RAplausos at the end and a hilarious then press conference also with applause.I applauded.</body>
