	<summary>Horny and full of references, especially to Argento or Brian De Palma film.</summary>
	<body>Last night I could not sleep and I swallowed this hilarious movie of terror "of all life" argument is delusional (I guess that about "Deliria"): a theatre company rehearse the play "The night of the OWL" and one of its actresses suffers from a problem in an ankle, so he decides to go to a doctor. in an insane asylum (!)To get there, Irving Wallace, a psychopath who killed a sixteen people (although they are not sure if there will be more, he is not very talkative, so says the doctor) escapes in the car of the actress, enclosing the company at the theatre and ending with them one by one in the way that best know, despedezándolos. (Hence the title of the Chronicle, do not you go to believe).Is super horny and full of references, especially to the film Argento or Brian Palma.Muy recommended for lovers of the genre, with a lively rhythm marked by the deaths (an every eight minutes). The film (uncredited) duration: 88 minutes.Number of deaths in the film: 11.Una phrase: "There is nothing like the entertainment world" indeed, because it is entitled "Aquarius", no idea.</body>
