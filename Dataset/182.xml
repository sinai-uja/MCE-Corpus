	<summary>Serie B lovers can enjoy the show proposed by Gunn</summary>
	<body>Returns the B series of the hand of James Gunn, a scriptwriter who outperformed in the recent dawn of the dead, and which has taken some references for his directorial debut: "The plague". Carpenter, Cronenberg and own Rosemary are a spring that Gunn has absorbed, which monster of the film, to show us this lineup produced, as a good genre film, in a typical village of the deep America, with the typical characters and typical development. In his favour I have to say that it was a little distance, giving a different touch of comical and making the characters, despite not ceasing to be so, have slightly different behaviors. The pattern is clear: a meteorite arrives carrying an extraterrestrial creature that needs a body to be able to propagate. After that a massive Legion of alien slugs will try to seize the village by its inhabitants, among which are the Chief of police and the beautiful protagonist to prevent this from happening. No doubt one of the highlights are its special effects, in mixed digital effects with the prosthetic, reaching an interesting atmosphere.In short, nobody is going to find innovative things in a movie from the start shows us his touch and his homage to the B series, so lovers of this genre can enjoy the show proposed by Gunn.</body>
