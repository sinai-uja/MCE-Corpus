	<summary>Nice film of "great robbery".</summary>
	<body>"An agent of precious stones, who works for a large organization, is mandated to make carving a large stone in the form of Opal, and which will provide for a beautiful woman." For this he received a large amount of money. "The stone is stolen, so the life of the agent and his girlfriend, who accompanied him on the trip, will change completely".Entertaining film framed in the subgenus (not because their overall quality is bad, or anything, but simply for not being in "great genres", however, overlooked some easily.) The reason is that almost everything is subject to a great robbery, forgetting the rest easily. Except the superb interpretation of James Mason, exquisite and tender as a few times, still very well accompanied by Charles Grodin in a serious role, and not as now, that makes many patochadas and the always-charming Candince Bergen. The rest of the great intérprertes are generally British, such as exquisite and always remembered Trevor Howard or the great John Gielgud.Se goes well while while it lasts and then there is almost nothing, but it is agrdable.</body>
