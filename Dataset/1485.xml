	<summary>A happy review of the animated films we saw of kids.</summary>
	<body>I still remember every year at Easter, along with the films of the Bible and Jesus Christ, they added to the programming a film of Gallic heroes, "The twelve tasks of Asterix", "Asterix en Egypt". part of those movies that one has been seen sitting on the floor of House sipping a Nutella sandwich.This new installment could not be different, has the air then films, while the chavaler√≠a who settled the room nullify the few but strange jokes and is that where I saw the film, had only 2 available sessions in the film. (Gentlemen distributors, "elders" also loves the cinema of animation.) and all the "dwarves" populating the room and talked about the film, disservice they do these "future" film fans loudly.Finally, perhaps the only discordant note is that tone of "update" which has the film, with the dove of the protagonist, or the name of the Vikings (where there is up to an Ikea) out there around. a happy review of the animated films we saw of kids.</body>
