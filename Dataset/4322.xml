	<summary>Saved from the unmitigated disaster by the two monsters who are burdened with his charisma to rescue the film from the absolute apathy.</summary>
	<body>Director ROB REINER was once someone really important with a list of films which highlighted the Princess Bride, MISERY, account with me among others. Eventually demonstrated talent stay completely buried in a list of products simply abominable from our history to say there would foreshadow anything good in his career.For resurgence has convinced two of biggest performers of the time to work together, they agree on top for the first time on screen. Of course I mean the winner of several Academy Awards that already coincided with REINER on some good men JACK NICHOLSON accompanied by an actor diametrically opposite style of interpretation because it is quite more content as shows it his works in a mano a mano in without forgiveness or imprisonment, I mean no doubt also great MORGAN FREEMAN.Despite the very different styles of both, chemistry is established from the outset is totally key to sustain a loose film.A paved with good intentions but not in this film makes film quality, is burdened by a script seen a thousand times, by little credible situations again by an address without force which signed and some air to TV in his mediocre mise en scène.Nor highlights technically, or in your photography, music or costume, being the typical drama of desktop where you try to do cry by very sobados by the film dramatic mechanisms which leads to boredom.Saved from the unmitigated disaster by the two monsters who are burdened with his charisma to rescue the film from the absolute apathy.</body>
