	<body>Between my friends and acquaintances, it is normal to always end up talking about film, and is, as everyone knows my you aversions and f√≥bias towards this calling 7 th art, always me someone recommending me movies, many (the vast majority) take note of them and I am postponing them in a section called (next screenings), others, that is, left in a corner of oblivion and give thanks for the recommendation and little else, this tape, which, a priori had to be of the latter, at the end and through the intermediary of my wife (we know who sends in house.) ended up seeing her, surprisingly she ended up staying asleep and I, (also) surprisingly finished see without revolver me on the couch or to say that it was a sovereign idiocy is that believe me that in this type of film, on countless occasions I am that, or falls asleep, either with 10 min. footage of me enough to have an opinion reliably work either just removing the cable from the XBOX which connects to the Pc monitor and I hear background while I play some video game.And is that the film revolves more before the pute which submits Robin Williams to the protagonists, and if any of the readers have passed by the procedure of organizing a wedding you sentireis identified, although, on the other hand, the movie falls into the thousand and one situations seen previously. Mandy Moore as always, one notch in his revolver, Robin Williams sympathetic, histrionic and brutally funny, as well as the small accompanying him, another of the bombs of the film.In no time I say that the tape is a masterpiece, but not bad at least entertains and identifies "husbands consorts" we suffer this type of film.</body>
