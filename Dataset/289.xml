	<summary>Finally it seems that things are done well in the world of film vs. video games, it was a memorable adaptation time</summary>
	<body>For a time this part live adaptations of video games, some made by visual terrorist Uwe Bowl, others, notable and/or completely dispensable (adaptation of "Mario Bros" or "Street Fighter II") finally seems to do things right in the world of film vs. video games, already it was time to a memorable (and not unfortunate) adaptation as they come always.Christophe Gans, proposes a dark film with touches of "bad feeling" and excellent work with an argument related to the video game, Radha Mitchell, Sean Bean (for my will always be "Boromi") as well as Laurie Holden (which was known by "The Majestic"), the only negative note that I see is that it seems that they lose a bit in giving a grim meaning to the movie and this has just falling in a spiral where one failed to understand part of the plot initial, go to or you are very attentive, or as you paste a cabezada, or look at the neckline of your viewing partner!These lost!In short, a more than decent adaptation of the video game, which have to be attentive to 500%.</body>
