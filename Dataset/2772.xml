	<summary>Alien tragicomedy that despite being full of vitality is more bitter than sweet and confirms that Santiago Lorenzo has an extraordinary talent without budgets and with an interesting script. Lorenzo returns to break my heart.</summary>
	<body>What good stories counter is Santiago Lorenzo! A decade after MOM is boba returns to theaters to tell us the story of two characters played by two serious candidates for the Goya: Arturo, a wretched who loses everything (brilliant Diego Martín) and Onofre (dazzling Juan Antonio Quintana), an old man who participates in the project "Second youth" and that for 40? monthly provides "a home" youth troop care minimum.The movie is an alien tragicomedy that is more bitter than sweet despite being full of vitality and confirms that Santiago Lorenzo has an extraordinary talent without budgets and with an interesting script and a handful of players in State of grace makes it possible to the miracle.I hope to not have to wait another ten years to see his third movie.</body>
