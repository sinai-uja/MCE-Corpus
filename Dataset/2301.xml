	<body>To leave the room, after seeing this film, the feeling was very clear, that disappointment. The third part of this series of films, which globally defined as a meeting of friends that also gives the chance that is filmed, is equal to the above in the form, but not the bottom.I mean, like the other two installments, the story is very simple, argument barely exists, and turn theft is becoming more exaggerated. Agree, all that we have assumed, and it is not a surprise. But both the first film, as especially the second, had a few scenes of dialogue simply unforgettable. Fun, spontaneous and that made you laugh, you repet√≠as some phrases and scenes to anyone who you asked about the movie, thanks mostly to the chemistry between Clooney and Pitt, to which was added some time Damon in his role as the pardillo against two veterans. Because all that does not exist in this third part. It is as if they had forgotten to screenwriter hire. There is no funny phrases, there are no scenes for remember, the characters go through with little time to say anything, and above all, the feeling that are without wanting to, without the impetus and excitement of the second part. Do we have then? Because hardly anything. There is no story, there is no pace, there is a fun plan to steal, that does not make sense only and the side is as if were not. In the end, you can laugh a little, but disappoints those who liked them the previous, and the rest will surely not they liked either, by still maintaining the style of trying to make a comedy. But a comedy jokes and good dialogues this clear will not be a great success.</body>
