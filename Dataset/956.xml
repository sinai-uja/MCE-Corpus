	<body>I don't like that a film needs a prior explanation to view it, or they will have to explain. It is like a book prologues, which only have to serve to thank and things like that, not to explain what it is. That already makes the book, which is the work you actually buy. As the same with movies. It cannot be that you will see one and do not know if it is a documentary, if they are actors, whether it is serious or if it is a farce.The film is about a journalist of Kazakhstan ranging to the U.S. to make a documentary about life in the country and thus to modernize their own. Travels with a big producer (and we assume that the camera was recorded, which does not leave) and companion of hardship. In his tour of the United States shows how people of the America deep to situations that he raises react. It seems that he tries to be a current portrait of the United States, from within.Never, I repeat never, I have seen more bad than this film. Jokes that makes seem me not funny while situations seem pathetic and embarrassed. The portrait that shows this kind of documentary can be very faithful which is happening on the first power, but what interest does outside its borders? And what is more, it should show as well? No, call this film seems very bold, with jokes of the sort that fucks (sexy show) to her sister or that has locked a brother delayed between bars while his sister teaches him the rabbit. Found it me even outrageous.In short, the worst "movie" I have ever seen. A total and absolute scam for the Viewer, where, without a warrant or concert trafficking to the limit "normal" situations. Vomit.</body>
