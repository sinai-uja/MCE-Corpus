"At the beginning everything is going well, but need to increase doses, thereby peligrará their vision."Very good sci-fi film that has finished being an indisputable classic. The reason is none other than the wonderful direction of Roger Corman, a man capable of making success any peliculilla on the role. It was with the help of the extraordinary contribution of Ray Milland, just great. Very good photography and superb sets, for a story with multiple readings where morals and ethics are of great importance.

How far should it go to achieve our purpose?Interesting reflections narrated very entertaining and fascinating.The end of the film, unforgettable.</body>
