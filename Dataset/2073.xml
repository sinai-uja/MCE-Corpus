	<body>You are not a successful actress if you don't have a teaching tape, so Hillary Swank, with his brilliant career could not be an exception, here gives life to Erin Gruwell, a teacher who really exists and that with the Foundation "Freedom Writers" (original title of the film), has managed to get to many of the ghetto boys go to College and become people of benefit.I have to say, that a server has quickly been immersed and at the same time identified with the story, and not by the ghetto, but because some years of my life I spent them giving computer and accounting classes to kids of more diverse, more, today, in my current work spend some days (now that the warm weather arrives) teaching training cycles, by teaching, in some way, running through my veins. Perhaps, this is the main premise that one needs to identify itself with the final result, a tape that produced with the baton of MTV (that do not know if it is good or bad, but there it is), and covered 2 years after the race riots that ravaged L.A., presents as well as the doubly Oscarizada Hillary Swank, for a casting tonot to be varied, found some good pearls (as the character of Swank which leads to the neck), which is worth discovering, in addition to Imelda Stauton (already is fraguaba in this film his next role in the new adventures of Harry Potter) and that is a priori as interpretativamente camaleónica, which one can hate or worship in a matter of seconds; on the other hand we have the television Patrick Dempsey (famous for the Tv series "Grey Anatomy") and here is the long-suffering husband of the protagonist in a linear, almost predictable role, and is by more than firms trying to get into the head otherwise, today, the personal life conciliation / working life is fully utopian.A concise, typical and topical tape (there are 100 films of similar characteristics) that, under the veil of "based on a true story" manages to touch the Viewer, and at times even excite (okay, I admit, I almost cry in a couple of cuts from the footage); its reverse negative have disagree with this abuse of voice-over (me cannnsa so that film resource), some moments, completely empty and/or stupid, and certain doses of fantasy (seems at times sponsored by "Bricomanía" for what of "If you can imagine, can be made" prior to the shelve this, my opinion, admire an excessive good job at some levels of the film)especially when the character of Swank begins to read newspapers, and as one is watching the stories and anti-militarists gradually with all the kids (well, that you put in your pocket in a moment).So that if I have that you as a "teacher" I liked, and that has left me good taste but. (there is always buts in this film).</body>
