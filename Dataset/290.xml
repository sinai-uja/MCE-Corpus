	<summary>Comedy, in short, leaving a very good taste in mouth</summary>
	<body>Nice comedy Adam Sandler reminds partly "Like God" and "Tale of Christmas of Charles Dickens" which is that the end of the film so reminds it, even "That beautiful is live" Capra, although it would be further too, and of course in the Adam Sandler movie is almost ask something impossible.Interpretive level, I'll take more than Sandler (that makes it always), with Kate Beckinsale, that leaves bellisima and Christopher Walken, which is eaten on screen all actors with only his presence, as well as Sean Astin nice its role (although for my always be "LOTR" Sam).If I would like a little loop the loop, draw the moralina that all moriríamos have a command of these característicias, in order to enjoy more time with the family, rest more normal hours because of work and advance those bad times that have to happen in life you want to or not, but thatAnother is sing, and we are not here to talk about it.Finally, a comedy that, in a nutshell, leaves a very good taste.</body>
