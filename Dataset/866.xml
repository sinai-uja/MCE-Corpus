	<summary>A love of the old story of the beautiful, that without saying anything, it says it all</summary>
	<body>Having seen the primordial version of 1933 as barely a couple of days ago, was to be expected that it happened to me all the footage (which is a lot) making comparisons, and I must say that while the 1933 version worked perfectly with its 100 minutes, this version works equally well with their monstrous 180 minutes, coming to develop parts of the plot that I missed in the first film.One of these parts is the wonderful story of love that arises between the beautiful Naomi Watts and the beast Kong, a love of the old story of the beautiful, that without saying anything, it says it all, and has been this aspect of the film that truly me has fallen in love (forgive the redundancy). Two moments to remember: the sunrises, and ice skating.With regard to the special effects it must be said that Mr. Jackson exceeded slightly, especially in the beginning of the movie when he introduces us the context of New York in the 1930s and where the computer used for things that actually have because done digitally, but is something for the not very smart pass unnoticedon the other hand the dinosarios and other infectos bichejos that populate Skull Island (island of the skull) are very achieved, but the jewel in the Crown is the giant monkey Kong, which especially in the close-ups shows us perfect, spotless, with all the details, and reaching a degree of quite surprising reality.Together with some pretty decent performances, good music and a pace quite fluid, make this work, the palomitera film par excellence of the Christmas season.</body>
