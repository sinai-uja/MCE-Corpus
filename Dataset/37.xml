	<summary>I gave very good roll</summary>
	<body>The film is about the life of Jose Monge, better known as Camarón de la Isla. Tells us, with the help of his music, his life from childhood until his death. Born in a neighborhood of Cádiz, he failed as a bullfighter, which made him flush with flamenco. Friend of Paco de Lucía, quickly shows its worth becoming a myth, even a Messiah. The bad of his life, were their continuous tonteos with cocaine and heroin, which accelerated his early death.Not be why was, but the film gave me a good vibe. And it is not it is especially happy, but music of shrimp and the good Flemish guitarreos give a festive air which is fine. The actor main does Camaron, has deservedly won the Goya, given that does a role very, very good. Not be as it would be shrimp, but this kid plays a very realistic and very suffered. I'll take a phrase from the movie: "that has clavao the DART" representing perfectly the face of estreñido of the above. In bad, Verónica Sánchez, who has become the substitute of Lina Morgan as eternal schoolgirl. Not intended it to us we create is a 15 year old girl? Come on man, by God, if instead of the test of the handkerchief he was made of the sheet (little santa). If I am not saying this I bust and filled it all of viscera.In short, deserves much see the movie. As an anecdote, the protagonist is the same "November", which gives him very good references.</body>
