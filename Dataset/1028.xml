	<summary>An excellent movie, not reaching the Viewer as much as it should. In some moments he lost pace, and in the end becomes excessively long.</summary>
	<body>Although the tape is very good, expected more from the new Eastwood approach to cinema, (more when in the near future we will have the other perspective, the Japanese), on the one hand have a history which, although excellent, sometimes loses pace, is true that Eastwood wheel masterfully scenes of war, and in some moments are you overwhelms the heart and is pressed you stomach (in the press pass have been reminded over and over again to) Spielberg and the beginning of "Save private Ryan") on the other hand, the film loses pace in some bars, and at the end it becomes excessively long, indeed, that I would dare to say that you spare almost the last half an hour.On the other hand, the combined acting is excellent, being the roster of faces known of outstanding most of the film, highlighting Ryan Phillippe, Paul Walker, Jamie Bell, and Barry Pepper, this last inserted already in war films, on the other hand, much promoted the emergence of Paul Walker in this movie and barely appears 10 min.Another negative of the film point resides on the repetitive soundtrack of Eastwood, who repeats again and again 7 musical notes, unless it comes to bore you too much to the Viewer, on the other hand, both historical reenactment, as the picture is excellent, as well as the sound, the moments one crouches in the room trying to dodge the bullets.In summary; an excellent movie, not reaching the Viewer as much as it should.</body>
