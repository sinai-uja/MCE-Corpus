	<summary>Cruel and quite raw. After an hour and a half of footage, when you get to the end you breathe, accompanied by a feeling of pain, guilt and hope that what you've seen on screen is there and does not happen again.</summary>
	<body>Interesting pseudo-documentary directed by Michael Winterbottom, after the excellent "code 46" and the mediocre porn pseudo-película "9 songs" delves deeply into the situation of Islamic prisoners at the American base in guantanamo.The film or documentary (don't know very well call it), it is hard, cruel and quite raw, and finally after hour and a half of footage, when you get to the end you breathe, accompanied by a feeling of pain, guilt and hope that what you've seen on screen is there and does not happen again.It has struck me, something already I saw on the page of film "The lost hours" and that they also commented, the protagonists following the unfortunate incident did not feel bad, it goes backwards, felt that this experience had helped in their lives; I would not put me on your skin, but I think that if he saw me in that position, I do not know if I would feel like them, probably would not like to see an American flag in my bloody life.Anyway, like the tape which I got yesterday my opinion / criticism, a film which is worth seeing, although during that hour and a half suffer nearly as those who are on screen.</body>
