	<body>Many films in the horror film used the mockumentary to achieve greater realism with less budget. Some of them ended up breaking the box office "The Witch of BLAIR, Cannibal Holocaust" are the most known, why not cases the only nor the best examples.At the beginning of the ninety one unknown Belgian director "only has a previous film" with a cast of non-professional except the protagonist that we saw in ASTERIZ or NARCO. Is the manga bag a genius that we hope time put in place.Unfairly or by the whims of fate this film lacks prestige, unknown to most, its popularity is practically non-existent when we are with probably the most outstanding of this type of film example.Told with such humour is frozen you the smile, the crimes committed with millimeter precision accompanied by creepy dialogues. The interpretation of the main actor is simply anthology, realism to each level you wrapped up in this infernal aura of facts so heinous that it can almost taste the pain.Music and photography end up accompanying this little masterpiece of the macabre.</body>
