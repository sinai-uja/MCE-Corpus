	<body>Second press pass to which I go, thanks to Warner, new film by Christopher Nolan, where we wonder with the picture that already showed us both "Insomnia" and "Batman Begins", where shares one of the protagonists, Christian Bale (tremendous in all its splendor), accompanied by Hugh Jackman, which little by little and after "Scoop" by Woody AllenIt seems that it begins to erase the traces of Wolverine who had left in the international movie buff scene, a Michael Caine (who also appeared in the new adventures of the bat man) in State of grace, and a Scarlett Johansson appearing of mere comparsa, to show off type, should talk about Bowie, but step why his character bores me, in addition to seem me little credible, as well as the short walk of Andy Serkis on screen.Film that leaves a good taste in the end, where one leaves the thoughtful film, and although the film is a bit dodgier, the result not inferior in any way, perhaps, the only downside I see is a slump at the beginning of the second Act, where the movie stops to launch dive until the end, go, almost like a roller coasterI can not forget me great setting and time, which leaves surprised more than one costume.In short, that we should expect eager to January 12, for its premiere.</body>
