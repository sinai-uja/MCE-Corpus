	<body>Last lap, (Tallega nights: The ballad of Ricky Bobby, 2006, Adam Mckay), despite not having any copy in v.o.s., the umpteenth demonstration that here that sends is Mr. Will Ferrell. Forget about Stillers, Wilsons or Carreys. This man is the only one that today manages to make me sweat in a room while I fall tears to contemplate his endless antics create more "last lap". The argument is the trilladísima story of self-improvement that much like the Americans. In fact, the movie is americanísima. from the point of view uncouth ybipolarmente improvised of Ferrell, seconded by a glorious John C.Reilly, who passes it big, and a cast of regular Judd Apatow, Molly Shannon Superstar productions inculida. Huge the nemesis of the prota, the chameleonic Sacha Baron Cohen (Ali G and Borat).Perhaps it takes a little bit to boot, but entry in the field once not for even a second, despite not reaching the glorious limits of the reporter, becoming street the best it comedy this year. I understand that you negueis (fans) to see dubbed, but neither this nor Nacho Libre (do change the title of a movie that has a title in Castilian?) have been premiered in original version, so you have to make an effort, which will last rather little in poster. A 7´75.</body>
