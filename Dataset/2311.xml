	<body>Is the girl on the cover not that was a gymnast in the movie that I saw a school of gymnasts, that she was a rebel girl that or went to school or had to go to jail? I leave the question in the air, that intrigues me more to know how put you the gas in the soda.The film is about a few super heroes that were treated with a radioactive move a few years ago, causing that two brothers battle between them as if it were the same good and evil. Over the years, which was evil returns for more and the good has to train a group of kids to be superheroes and to stop his brother. And this is, is have not tronchado meninges, no. what want tell you? I bored me a bit with the movie, the children seem repellent, especially small. The super power of el gordo is offensive and absurd. Do not leave pechis or anything you like (what else gives it a movie for children?, a few nipples always encourage and not offend). Total, that thought crucify her, but told me my medium Zucchini "has been well the movie, right?" And I I have less psychological strength that a celery, I said, "psssi". So now I can not enact, ja, ja, ja.In short, film focused on a public very often. Of those who make the imagination of children and we jump the seams of the mouth to the elderly of yawning. Suitable only for children.Child exclusive use.kisses.</body>
