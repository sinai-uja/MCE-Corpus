	<body>While a lot Spanish film is burned to fast-forward (in case that you see on dvd), there are exceptions that are worth all the clunkers seen to date. Especially because Excel already a little bit in the middle is a feat.On the night of the sunflowers we see a story from several points of view with protagonists of very mixed and with a less "exotic" geographical setting for a thriller. Carmelo Gómez, Judith Diakhate, Celso Bugallo, Vicente Romero, Manuel Morón and Cesáreo Estébanez are the solid set interpretation that gives face to a tale of misery with effect dominated. How face the fear, revenge, and apathy. And the price that it costs do.A very interesting proposal that sinneth perhaps slow at times, but used to see an interesting script complexity interpretive, argumentative and sees a nice easily.One of the best I've seen this year and will participate in one of the most disputed sections of the awards Goya. Why not the prize will be less Sung, clear. Although I have my favorite: A franco 14 pesetas.</body>
