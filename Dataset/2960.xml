	<body>We are facing a very topical and predictable film. Only to see the poster and you say "HA!" "I know how it ends". But the film is so well done and performed, and it is so entertaining, that you just imported a damn.Well, it's not entertaining taaaaaaaan, because if a fat stick has this movie is its excessive length for what counts. Two hours of "aaaaaaaay I have no pa' coméeeeee!" and miserable several that Will Smith and his mini-negrito - cool MTV have to endure. As they say in the estimable web the hours lost, is the 'Terminator 2' films of kleenex. At times it is eternal and other very light, a very rare thing.But that is the only downside. Everything else is a joy. And Will Smith is enormous, his nomination to the Oscar is more than deserved, and the rest of the cast included his son, are at an altitude of dignísima.A ' how beautiful is to live!', much smaller, light and modern.Essential to the original version (as with all the movies, but hey.).</body>
