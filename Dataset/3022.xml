	<summary>Moore, play a bit with the feelings of the Viewer, have to be condescending and to realize that not only Spain people live with unusual income and that in the States "The country of opportunities" is the thing much more serious than it seems at first glance.</summary>
	<body>From "Bowling for Columbine" documentary 1st of this "orondo" filmmaker, I was attracted by the figure of Moore, and after seeing "Fahrenheit 911" with more reason, since both feel for Bush the same antipathy, this time the source of their "iras" is the Bush Administration regards the insurance medical/pharmaceutical industries and is which, unfortunately in a country as developed as the Statesthe "americanitos of a foot" do not have a health as in Spain, so much we complain and laugh "Spanish health" and things at least as primary as the 1st "idem" attention her make us for free, and it is that what Spain are keeps us in concept of Social Security in the USA not, that is paid to the worker, and he, on his own, has to afford health insurance, nothing easy, since mission as the "impediments" list is long, long and difficult I would say.It is true than typical in Moore, play a bit with the feelings of the Viewer, there to be condescending and to realize that not only Spain people live with unusual income and that in the States "The country of opportunities" this the thing much more serious than it seems at first glance, and that the insurance companies (I repeat, USA no security social.) are much more cruel than it seems, denying insurance by thin or fat, leaving families on the street, or denying something as easy as an implant hearing to a creature that begins to live, so Moore plasma with great ease, speed and hilarity on the screen, trying and getting at the same time, that we shrink not only the heart but also the soul, in the first stages of footage.Moore not only analyzes the lives of these "unfortunate people", but the world of professionals that comprise, from doctors, until former employees of insurers, translating, which sadly not only in the USA is also a reality, there is not the person, there is only business, and Moore and the companies know, is as that article that spoke of what it was polluting Al Gore in their appointments with the press about his documentary "green", that the business is higher than the interest prior, sad, but real and save dollars, more is better, the rule number ONE of every company, be devoted to what be devoted, even to human lives, arriving to assess whether a drug is necessary or not to go on living, with unfortunate and harmful consequences.Moore undertakes to treat the images of the most bloody way, with music sad when the occasion requires and historical passages that you afianzas if his narration is even more worth and, as in previous tapes, giving background and packing everything what counts through the voiceover, and a thousand and one narrative resource utilization.</body>
