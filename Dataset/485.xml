	<summary>The best safe since the day of the beast (or the first stream) and Jose Corbacho which is a child of the great whore and passes it big.</summary>
	<body>Ten years ago, the Farrelly brothers signed, always under my humble opinion, his magnum opus: go couple of idiots (Kingpin) now, a decade later, Óscar Aibar, director of the comiquera (ydifícil) quagmire and the wonderful flying saucers, pays tribute to the American piece with this covert remake which is the fun (but a tad long, almost two hours) the machine dancing.Let's say that the production of buddy Segura what to Kingpin wasps nest was the assault on Precinct 13. And it works because it has a photograph an excellent cast, with this great actor Jordi Vilches, the best safe since the day of the beast (or the first stream) and Jose Corbacho, which is a child of the great whore and passes it big and overwhelming (in charge of Teo Delgado).I am surprised in a positive way the Americanization of this type of comedy, ranging from the aforementioned brothers Farrelly to the most recent Dodgeball or the benchwarmers, passing through tributes to Karate Kid, Gremlins, or even lifetime (crappy) Delta Force type action cinema (or Sudden death), these hand in hand with the always fun Enrique Villén. And the eye of the Tiger, of course.Surprise Bárbara Muñoz, completely credible in the role of megapija Raritan. Nacho Vigalondo has a funny cameo without being a movie cameos. Come on, isn't a Wilder but you throw a few laughs.A 6´5. PS: Living the philosophy of cheap movies.</body>
