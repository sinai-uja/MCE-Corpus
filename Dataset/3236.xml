	<summary>Romero returns to be the slowest. His movies are on autopilot in almost sonrojante manner. But are not very hard with me, it is only my opinion.</summary>
	<body>God (and you) to forgive me, but personally the Romero film increasingly interest me less. His latest work neither excites me and I get bored in most parts of the footage, not to say throughout the film.The usual speech and staging of always with a new point of view that has been common in many proposals this year, live camera, the reality and the manipulción. Who is telling the truth? Where do we find it? It may seem a boldness, but my I like more the new batches to the style of the pattern: Zack Snyder fascinated me with its frantic review of dawn of the dead and Danny Boyle me enthusiastic about his cutting 28 days later.Movies with similar speeches were (in the case of the remake, because the same) and had a devilish pace and a spice of reinvento (to siiii, how difficult it had done Romeeeero) situation that made them shine so hard that they became related films and new classics of cinema in general and in particular of the fantastic.Here the time returns to be slow, as if it were "the ballad" a furious drive and that is why I finished getting tired.Even Shaun of the dead seems superior to the two last works of a director, we will become crazy, have more than one peñazo important, as the face of revenge not. You know I'm not lying.</body>
