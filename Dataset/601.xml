The Chief doctor kills his protégé and buried him with his creations in an abandoned wing of the hospital. Time passes, twenty years are nothing, and enter a mysterious girl, suffering from induced amnesia in the hospital. His admission coincides with an earthquake which, coincidentally, opens the pit where the malevolent doctor and their zombies psychopaths have spent the past two decades.Directed by Brett Leonard ("the grass cutter") this film of 1989, called Spain "The pit of death", meets all the premises to spend a slum night and poligonera in our favorite sofa. Hilarious characters, ochentera aesthetics, music in the purest style Out Run, zombies destripa innocent, gore, occasional, cruel and wasteful, bad very bad, hero and a pretty girl that corretea in panties almost the entire film.The "buts"? the Serie-B classic: poor production, objectionable interpretations, implausible, and hackneyed argument dubbing insultante.ya know. That Yes, this her recommend personally, especially by the distressing atmosphere is very well achieved, making us give some other start in our Throne. hooks and orangeade for all!</body>
