	<body>The youth of today, in the slashers, die as in the 1980s. With a pair of knives, some screams, suspect one shade and adding a touch of gore, the formula still stands. Now comes another which follows the rules, but from Austria. Few films produced in this country come to light, and it is missing see more films filmed in their beautiful landscapes. This is one of the strengths of die in three days, give us the opportunity to make tourists looking at the scenario in which they occur quite ugly facts. Among the enormous mountains, and by a rather cold Lake, youngsters finished licence receive a message on the phone who tells them that they will die in three days. First is it do not take very seriously, but everything will change when one of them is killed.Starting with this approach, which could resemble the of call lost by Takashi Miike, the film features five young people with the same personality that may have an ATM. To the press a few buttons, activated accordingly. The surprises that holds us to die in three days are very few, not to say that you do not exist. As one of the characters says "why three days and not four?". Exactly, what does. It is a one-way argument, which begins well, but spent the rest of the film showing the same once again. It feels a bit that its director, Andreas Prochaska, has not been willing to risk a single frame so the tape can exit Austria towards all the countries who have read the manual Hollywood slasher.</body>
