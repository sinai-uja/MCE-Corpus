	<summary>It will Smith returns to the charts, with a film that is very different from that usually star. In this case does not have to deal with robots or abduction, in this occasion has a much more difficult rival, real life.</summary>
	<body>Produced by Gabriele Muccino (the last Kiss), "in search of happiness" tells the misfortune that has to overcome Chris Gardner to be able to succeed.Next to him is his son, presented as a great discovery. It is true that being his son really facilitates the work, making that a chemistry that another actor would cost much more, has but despite this, Christopher Syre Smith manages to fill the screen and complemented with "the Prince of Bel Air".In almost every family there is a mother, and in this film, this role lies with Thandie Newton (Crash), who plays the tormented and jaded wife of Gardner. Set in the 1980s, in the city of San Francisco, "in search of happiness" presents the miseries and misfortunes, the joys and sacrifices it has to undergo a father to support his family, and Will Smith made one of his finest works, not to say the best. Not in vain, the Academy has rewarded him with (for now) a nomination for an Oscar. In addition to the above-mentioned actors, a good movie is achieved by taking one side to help believe us everything, and in this case both executives and brokers of the company, as his friend and neighbor, or man of the machine to travel in time, help us to empathize with Smith and the film in general.There are many other aspects that help a movie stands out, and Andrea war is largely responsible for creating a very successful music.Ultimately, "in search of happiness" is not the year pelicul√≥n, but is shown as an interesting proposal for all those who want to get excited and suffer with the ups and downs of Chris Gardner, superbly played by Smith, who are lovers of the happy endings.</body>
