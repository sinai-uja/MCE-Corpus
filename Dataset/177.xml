	<body>There are films that if they are already a myth of cinema, although there are people who strive to get sequels and remakes. Psychosis is a myth of the cinema with a beginning and an end, masterfully made by Alfred Hitchcock, although as I said some try to get money by the genius of another showing his lack of ideas. I had the pleasure of seeing her for the first time this summer and it was amazing, films with too much fame and much recognition usually them have some reluctance to see them and I think many expectations about the film which can to end disappointed, with psychosis not occurred, I was foolishly watching the screen during the footage of the film. Hitchcock leads me to where it wants, as you want and when you want to, a real lesson in how create a magnificent horror film without having to show anything explicit only hinting.A perfect script with a soundtrack that perfectly accompanies the film creating a climax is magnificent. It's great from the beginning, with the McGuffin of the theft of the money, with the arrival at the motel and until the end. With the legendary Norman Bates (beautifully played by Anthony Perkins) and that mysterious motel with that terrifying Fund House, an argument that has been copied to the satiety or maybe is not that it has been copied if not that psychosis is the perfection of the suspense film, has it all. With mythical scenes such as the shower, which I was not surprised because of the numerous times that they have put it on television, a real bitch. Little more I can say I this movie has that not been said already, a landmark in cinema of psychopaths, an authentic masterpiece of essential viewing.</body>
