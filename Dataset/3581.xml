<review author="Jokin García " title="Habitación sin salida" rank="3" maxRank="5" source="muchocine">
	<summary>Movie without great pretensions that offers a fun time and gives it, but no one expected a masterpiece of terror, which is another ´producción more with clichés and clichés. Popcorn, armchair, another thing and entertaining evening.</summary>
	<body>Although of similar title, it has nothing to do with the "Lost room" series, but that Vacancy (its original title) is a horror film that used to hang out but will not go to the annals of the history of the movies of fear.Tells us the incident voyage of Amy (Kate Beckinsale, whom we have seen in such films as "Pearl Harbour" or "Underworld") and David (Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson rubio hermanísimo) a young marriage in crisis, who has just lost his son in a car accident and is in divorce proceedings, going through their last journey together. He chooses to take a secondary road, leaving the Interstate, and if something has taught us the American cinema is that all good secondary road its motel/gas station with psychopath.As it cannot be otherwise, the car breaks down and they have to stop in a sinister motel, dirty, flaking and doomed to suspend any inspection of the departemanto of health that throw you, and there they discover something quite frightening, the room is full of snuff tapes, and filmed in the room they are! And the nightmare begins when they discover that they are stars invited to one of these sinister films.The premise is interesting and (cinematically) manages to maintain decorum, not pass to a runs-that-you-pill between the protagonists and the bad, quite stereotyped all of them, but if you like the genre, without being a masterpiece, is entertaining (and I confess that it is a genre increasingly throws me more)</body>
