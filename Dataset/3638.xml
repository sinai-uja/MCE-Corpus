	<summary>Ultimately one of the summits of the decadent and sick gore.</summary>
	<body>The author of MANIAC COP dead or alive July 4 among others came to be one of the most brutal ever seen films.Shot almost in amateur mode which gives a rough look with a dirt so real that even thought if it was a SNUFF.A work that flies high above its scenes of death where he focuses on the figure of the killer (awesome JOE SPINELL Visto in rocky and the Godfather).A figure that degenerates gradually leading to a poetic ending shot with a strong force and adentandronos in a dark mind in an atrocious way. Even in spite of its low budget photography, music, decorados decorated stick well to this aura of nightmare being notable makeup giving realism to all its GORE scenes.If it were not enough acts the legendary CAROLINE MUNRO (Dracula 73 or Captain cronos).Ultimately one of the summits of the decadent and sick GORE.</body>
