	<summary>Infumable film that will like your audience and the rest like almost going to be that not. That no, that does not convince me, that not not and no, that is very bad.</summary>
	<body>To me the duos of Spanish comedians that do not go in 2, almost that can not stand them. Some grace I do, from time to time, but if we add and explain exclusion, leaving the operation refusal. Although it is true that, I was surprised this end of year seeing the special of no is who and riendome as a tontícola. It would be the effect of the alcohol added to the excessive amount of food? Or is it that I am older and I like Noche de fiesta someday? There is that.The film is about a few Gypsies who sell antiques. One day a gang of Russians - Italians want them to buy a reliquary containing the unique power ring linking inside to the. This, Jose Mercé anillaco. So one does not want to sell, others no longer want to buy if not kill the Gypsies is lia an absurdez ending with tits and a silent that retrieves speech. Or that me whole, ja kill me!What want tell you? Personally the film seemed an infumable pigswill, but I understand to have your audience, given that is a sense of humor to a sector of society. It is clear that so many nonsense as they say, some you have to make grace, but come on, the whole is infumable. I highlight the musiquilla that true is that I tarareé her a few times.In short, infumable film that will like your audience and the rest like almost going to be that not. That no, that does not convince me, that not not and no, that is very bad.Why leave pechis than if not.Besitos.P.D: have I commented that it is infumable?</body>
