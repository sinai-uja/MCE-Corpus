	<body>Preceded by a few good reviews, comes the new proposal of Judd Apatow shared many ingredient with "Supersalídos" (one of the surprises of the season), but that a difference of "Embarrassing mess" fails to live up to my expectations.Despite having very good moments, both humorously and romantically, and actors as interesting as Katherine Heigl and Seth Rogen, history doesn't just materialize at all.It is very good one of the phrases pronounced the protagonist at the end, when he sees how his life has been a complete reversal, and the moral if you stop to think about what has been achieved and resulted in random, chance and bad luck on Ben Stone and Alison Scott (the protagonists characters).We also appreciate life in couple, with their pros and cons, but in a later stage and something more adult in formed by Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann. Comparing this film with the rest of proposals, is not below, that comedy is not in the best of times, so can be disappoint lovers and cinéfagos to wait a good thing (more to the first than the latter) but even so, "Embarrassing mess" contains small amounts of love, humor and tenderness, that make that view it does not involve a mistake.As a curiosity, could well find us with a flashback or flashforward (or prequel / sequel) of the lives of the characters of Seth Rogen and/or Jonah Hill in "Supersalidos", seeing what they have become, or will become, as Seth Rogen is would have been able to become police and thus help McLovin, feeling identified with him (as confess the two cops in "Superbad") or Jonah end up being a "fumeta" that does nothing rather than be with colleagues, having lost his best friend and have not been able to go to the same University.In short, ramblings of a film buff/cinéfago.</body>
