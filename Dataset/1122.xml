	<body>Felipe Vega is a filmmaker already long history, but without a single (even small) success at the box office; seeing his latest film, "Women in the Park", are understood the reasons: tells well, tells a story more or less close, but the script is unfortunate, with middle class family in process of separation, his only daughter, and the many times that they meet (Incidentally, almost always at a table with food: why not her have entitled "Women in the restaurant"?) (Have you had been more informed?) to discuss your neuro. What follows again, as we already knew, that write scripts in tandem with writers (in this case with Manuel Hidalgo, despite the film buff pedigree of this? does a quarter-century ago was critical in frame magazine, amongst other means?) is not good idea, because you know that the knowledge they have writers in the world is through literature, which will be very artistic, but since then little Royal. A stodgy end in plan folletín the William Sautier Casaseca way with children and parents hairpieces and consequential, does not end just improve it. And it is that Felipe Vega, as well as making films on nearby people, should ensure that these people seem to be possible, inhabitant of the Earth, not of Mars?</body>
