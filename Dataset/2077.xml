	<body>The faithful gardener is a good film, mixed with great skill the denunciation of the situation in Africa and how big drug companies experience their drugs with the Africans, with a plot of suspense, which in principle may seem a bit convoluted, but is very well explained and the Viewer is not lost on the road. In other similar films, the plot is so liosa and full of names that no one learns anything of what has happened, however, this film is developed with clarity, despite being a complicated issue that touches at the end.During the first 40 minutes we enter in history, a great flashback in which we are told how the protagonists met and how they got to the current situation, may seem a too long preamble, but when it starts the other part of the film, all this is forgotten and you realize that it was necessary that prologue so long to know perfectly the story and not miss.Ralph Fiennes makes a good performance, his character undergoes an evolution very clear throughout the film, at the beginning is a diplomat and behaves as such, restrained and discreet, but as it is advancing the story increasingly express more emotions. Rachel Weisz is correct but not dazzling.</body>
