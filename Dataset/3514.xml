	<body>Love life, love people that fell in love with people and people who can not fall in love from the love of their children, of memories, of fantasy, strange, impossible, in a landscape of a city. Paris Je t'aime are numerous stories, each one of them directed by different directors of renown as Alfonso Cuaron and with a cast of actors that goes from unknown to commercial as Natalie Portman.Las stories in general are endearing and although there are some boring is not the tonic for all, it is impossible to get bored seeing this kind of betting to the "Manuale d'amore" already that if not enjoy seeing some of the storiesinsurance can coincide with another.I liked very much the merger that managers has been achieved with the history that they had that one extending all they in famous tourist places in Paris, a feat of great beauty, no doubt. This accompanied by changes of rhythm and narrative of each director makes that we are first and foremost a range of forms, colors and even smells.Film composed of small great films (shorts) that converge in a result absolutely brilliant and recommended for all those who are enamored with all possible forms of love to imagine.</body>
