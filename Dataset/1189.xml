	<summary>We must advocate from time to time for this film, and the film "made in Spain" is certainly a very good proposal</summary>
	<body>I said some weeks ago one of the regular columnists of the free newspaper DNA, which see Spanish film is laughing with our humor and enjoy our miseries, so perhaps the last film of David Trueba has served to feel identified with this proposal, given that starting from several points in common of a server with the story raised on the screenone already has an opinion quite contrary to what I have read about it on the tape.Samuel and Eva have been together 8 years (like a server and its media naranja), raised a life together (idem), and although still not have ceased to be a few kids have to deal with problems so far not even knew independently (idem), she more settled, firmer, with his feet on the Earth, (idem) and he a fucking disastera dreamer who thinks that everything can be fixed tomorrow and continues making things when it was a more than tender teen must face now a destination that almost you is upon (idem), if that join you an authoritarian mother almost would have the story of my life brought to the big screen, but can always resort to the views expressed in Filmaffinity (excellent site to which I owe an apology) and assess whether you deserve or do not go to see her.Once I have given you "sheet" step to comment a bit on the film, David Trueba composed a comedy (with some drops of drama), based on his own experience and starring Pilar López De Ayala and Alejo Sauras, the latter is pigeonholing in her television role as "son of the Sunia" and is difficult to separate him from this image, meanwhile Pilar López de Ayala begins to be with permission of many othersone of the most beautiful (and popular) faces the Spanish film, his appearances in the film are full of unique moments, and being even the "Fuller" of the film, their interventions leave maybe the tape of Trueba.La film is littered with cameo appearances, and from Neus Asensi, passing through many of the friends of Trueba (even the dog of his brother Ferdinand)It shows the "buenrollo" in the realization of the same; the splendid Concha Velasco, that looks so pretty and glamorous as yesteryear would need to mention. (Also turns the same day as I).Finally, there is that from time to time to advocate for this film, and the film "made in Spain" is certainly a very good proposal.</body>
