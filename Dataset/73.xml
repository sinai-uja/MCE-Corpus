	<summary>Nothing to do with the ancient struggle between werewolves and vampires</summary>
	<body>Not be if I have already said this, but have to be something I'll stick with vampires, who the werewolves have neither glamour nor na na. Vampires, where it will stop are uncouth and rude, much better.The film is about a vampire who has killed a great vampire and now all the other vampires the Chase to kill her. She is not alone, since there is a hybrid licántropo is beside her (although it does more to annoy, but it is). On the other hand it is the primordial vampire, who has mutated and now has wings and very nasty. And he is dedicated to pursuing these two to get some stuff. And in addition get a man who does not understand that he paints the end, who runs an organization that have weapons that kill much (in theory, which are then cow poop). Well, nothing to do with the ancient between werewolves and vampires fight, as they say in advertising.On the one hand we have large doses of special effects, with transformations of humano-licántropo and humano-vampiro which are really worth. Action are curradas and are quite brutal. But the subject of the script weakens enough. Yo is that these films which can not open a door because they need some ancient keys, since the invention of dynamite, seems total nonsense. It is also pretty long, but do not understand why, given that few things happen. Basically, nothing, that they fight and fight. And by the way, the werewolves have become mere little who die with staring them. Ah, I forgot, is the parallel story of the birth of vampires, that a film could be made only of that fine. Habemus prequel?To sum up, or going to the cinema to get hand into the moments that do not kill or sofa and blanket when you convaleces of a disease and not want to think.</body>
