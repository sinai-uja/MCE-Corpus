	<body>More than curious, would describe her entertaining comedy geek, where a type already entered years bad to the 30 already almost we denote as "agüelos", moves to House of her grandmother and her illustrious companions of House.It is curisoso that tache of geeks to all those kids that have spent part of his life in front of a console, computer or similar, and yet have things to say and contribute and smoking! (hehe).They include, among others, in a comedy that copará the shelves of DVD-clubs, among others, the presence of Linda Cardelini, away from his role in Scooby Doo, and Rob Schneider, allowing a cameo at the beginning of the same, by the way, the tape produces Adam Sadler, who would have him allowed also a cameo, insofar as they participate in the film most of their peers of the mythical "Little Nicky".Finally, a simple film, which entertains, visiona quickly and end up forming part of most rented in any dvd-club.</body>
