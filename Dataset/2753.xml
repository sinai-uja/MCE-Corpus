	<summary>Many things for 20 minutes. It is based on real events, do not say more.</summary>
	<body>Well, that two or three risotadas I stick with macabre, ochentera (because it is 1980) work first by Lamberto Bava which is impossible to explain without gutting, so you you jodéis **.Those who do not want to read already know.The thing starts with an Earless banner that awaits her husband leaves to gigs to go to see / fuck a guy with a mustache who died decapitated Fred to get out of a curve when concucía to any host with the banner Earless co-pilot on the way to her house because her son just died drowned. at the hands of his devilish older sister of thirteen or asín. Many things for 20 minutes, so the rest of the movie is from the point of view of a blind man who hears at night to the Earless (and now mad) banner, because it has been depending on the five-year overview and the movie an anno dopo. in a fucking insane asylum practicing sexual intercourse with the head of Fred, that keeps in the freezer the very bitch.In the end, in a tour de force progioso (indeed, if you see up to 15 minute of movie and jump to the last four you see everything) of little more than five minutes, the Earless banner kills his daughter (drowning her, as no, but. and blood?) and gets to practice sex with the head. The blind her surprises and kills her in the oven (!). Then you hear a breath. the blind man is approaching the bed. and the head bite you the jugular. Fine. is based on real events, do not say more. ** lovingly and with care. Seriously, it is made destripada with love so go to the grain if you get to see her.</body>
