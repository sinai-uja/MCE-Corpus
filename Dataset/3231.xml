	<body>Every time you are appointed to ROGER CORMAN one should perform reverences, maybe wasn't the best director but I dedicate his entire life to serie b in all kinds of genres with full passion in directing and production.Gave us small jewels "pendulum and death, terror," in is occasion accompanied one of the greatest interpreters of the film, also great history in a number of roles in the horror genre.RAY MILLAND "Obsession, the haunted mountain, sea serpent" made up another of his fascinating work in the skin of the scientist who plays to be God.A fairly harmless initially only shows the characters, explaining the theory of experiment of fairly light way. To gradually enter into the self-destruction of the man who does not know to stop his research on time.This narrated reliably without artifice or a big budget, nobody as CORMAN bag so imaginative way his films always scarce media. It is allegory leads to a bottom of a harrowing brutality where man realizes his abuse in the pain he feels in his eyes already useless. The film suffers from some absurd dialogues and the technical ways unconvincing, although only for the final part accompanied by that great actor visiona welcome and causes great concern.</body>
