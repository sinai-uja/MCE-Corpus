	<body>Ben Affleck ebuta successfully in the direction of this film whose plot is based on the novel by the author of Mystic River. Great sound editing for a film whose peak is located within the first hour the next half-hour film, it seems that you rate down considerably to lead us to a final intuíble "than not predictable".I liked especially the view that Ben decided to tell this story. Tension is maintained and not lost the plot thread at any time.Ben puts in charge of the film to his adorable brother Casey Affleck (assumed his first protagonist and must say that it supports the weight of the film in a manner more than commendable) who plays a private detective who along with his wife managed his own business of private detectives. His routine is altered when the family of a missing girl hire their services to suspect that the police is not throwing all the light that should be the case of the disappearance.The protagonist will be involved in a game of lies and opportunistic, finally committed and indecisive played between what "is right" and "what should".Recommended film seems to me profitable for Ben. We'll see far gets. I imagine that the choice of history is preceded by the success garnered Mystic River, perhaps hoping that on this occasion this fact be repeated.</body>
