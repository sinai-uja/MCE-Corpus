	<summary>A well shot thriller that loses its bellows at the bottom.</summary>
	<body>The movies discrete, when they are in film, are in almost all media. And I found this in Digital Plus.Dark Blue, Ron Shelton with Kurt Russell is a police thriller got in dark business and corruption of the body in blue uniform. The character of Russell, Eldon Perry, is in charge of a new "cub" of police, Bobby (Scott Speedman). It will discover the methods that follows its "master" to solve certain problems or to provide the security that they represent.However everything has a much more visible structure. And its maximum authority it stars the always disturbing Brendan Gleeson. The appearance of this mafia-like character changes us the vision we have of the Eldon. The good work of Russell makes us it clear that many of these police thugs (in Los Angeles in 1992, at the time of the racial lynching) are not in fact. They are mere little who down look to their heads and obey without complaint. But they reach both believe what they do they lose the sense of what they do. Certainly lose it unless they themselves are a problem. So when you look at risk, absolutely everything changes.Family in the life of these agents is also a factor. How some take home their misery or simply do not carry them, taking a woman and a child completely unattended.A well shot thriller that loses its bellows at the bottom with a sequence absolutely naive and impossible. But serving for the redemption of the character, obviously. Let us not forget that after these characters as corrupt will always be honored others who want to do their job. And they will want to do well.Interesting.</body>
