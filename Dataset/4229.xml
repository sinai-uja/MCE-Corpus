	<body>Richard Gere has turgid. Isn't as cool as in the 1990s and finally it shows in their tapes (it has cost him but he has finally grasped the concept that be hoary and sexy is not attractive when you're almost an old man).In the shadow of the Hunter it plays a fearless reporter of war in full replay of Bosnia loses the chaveta and gets to rant. The ten years of the conflict become reporters to the area and he reunited with his camera of a lifetime (that is now a well-off Chamber of the host star in New York and not the play in armed conflicts). Then it drops the bomb, says that he knows where to find the Fox, a type which controlled the roost during the war with which also has some outstanding accounts. As journalists are not stone just, along with rookie turn, kicking the mountain in search of the bad guys.Richard Shepard directs and also writes the screenplay staying anchored in an unlikely succession of scenes that sometimes rub the ridiculous. Not pro opts social complaint or by the thriller so decides to use parapet its three protagonists using their performances to save the tape.We miss a little consistency between the complaint and the actions that take place on the screen. Also at some point turns everything into a kind of comedy film where it seems more important the skullduggery of the character of Gere that the objective of the group.A disaster turned into any commercial product.</body>
