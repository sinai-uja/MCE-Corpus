	<body>Cars that talk? We humanizamos to motor vehicles? The truth is that the gender of the animation is running out of arguments and increasingly have to think much more to get surprise to the audience. And with this amazing course.The film is about Lightning Mc Queen, a young arrogant and very subidito ego racing car. After a strange career in which solved the Piston Cup, should do a repeat on the other coast of the United States. As it is an unbearable and stupid car, traveling aboard his only friend, but midway lost and ends in a route 66 town, called Radiator Springs. There is sentenced to fix the road previously destroys and, with the help of all the people, gets to change their attitude and the those who surround him.Well, this film I got slightly bored. The beginning I did not like anything, given that everything points to a movie more than those that do not contribute anything. A winner is abandoned by his team and spends the entire film learning the importance of friendship and teamwork. And this I start to get bored. But as he was moving the film, the thing is improving, great secondary characters and the story goes to the front. It has very gracisoso moments, such as tractors and the mower. It has overcome, and tender moments moments of crying and some humor. But will not let be another film of the genre, it exudes moralina and I have far from clear that cale in the children in society. It seems to me that these obvious moralizing already fail and begin to be somewhat tiresome.In short, long animated film from the factory Pixar would be a work master if not because it is the umpteenth masterpiece from the factory. I liked, but I fails to kill the illusion.</body>
