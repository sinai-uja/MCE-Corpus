	<body>That can be expected of a film which includes a bug that Dan fright, the word hunt and the bloody word in its name? For that, one movie of bichas (as they say in the South) fat, that make a bloody Hunt (that joke more bad) with a bunch of greedy to be richer than the Kasogui (as written).It is that the serpientazas are living in an area of the jungle where it grows a bloody Orchid (rather red and goes it kicks). And some pharmaceutical laboratories, who do not know the existence of the anacondas, discovered that these orchids are sorted to make you immortal. I do not understand well because you want to fuck the business of curing people creating a drug that makes you immortal, but it does.Total, that is mounted the typical expedition, with good aunts, the mindless, the black funny, the Tosk handles that dazzles the solid, that you see the second scene that will die eaten by all the snakes in the world and a pair of armadillos and the simple bait. They arrive in the Amazon and weapon of God is Christ. If the handles loaded a crocodile with the hands, if it bites me a spider, that if that seemed silly is the more bastard and want to get rich, that snakes have more hunger than me at 3 in the morning, etc.In the end, it passes what we already know all, so I do not. The movie is well to sit with your popcorn on a rainy Sunday and not lift me more than to piss (or for more popcorn). Personally the movie I liked, although we must recognize that it is a little fart. But all my movies of bugs me are cool, heh, heh.</body>
