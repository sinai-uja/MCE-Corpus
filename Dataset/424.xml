	<summary>Great film genre (fantasy, it is understood) filmed as if it were a story.</summary>
	<body>M has done again it. Man, not reached the excellent results of the protected, but is fighting with signals in my Top 3 Shyamalan particular (the second is forest). Demonstrates once again that it is the best composing levels, then filming them and giving suspense to any story that comes to mind. I am not going to tell you anything about the movie to not make you a predetermined idea of the film, but it is a wonderful film genre (fantasy, it is understood) filmed as if it were a story (that is). It is a tale. With the successes and the shortcomings that entails. Poignant Paul Giamatti, excellent girl Howard and the highest cast of side of M to date. This time, the usual paper reserves the director has far more relevance than usual, but no matter, not at odds with his character. How to clash, if he has written? Wonderful image which gives the film critics (are) and perhaps lame to say the least, the usual humor of his movies, that if in this film works on occasion, slashing forced elsewhere. And have three (or four) resolutions. (To no end) Anyway, Shyamalan is vigorous in the direction, and music orchestrated by the usual James Newton Howard is outstanding. We must see it. 8.</body>
