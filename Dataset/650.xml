	<summary>The performance and direction of Tommy Lee Jones (speaking with a Mexican accent Spanish...) and the screenplay of Guillermo Arriaga become worthy of mention and observation tasks.</summary>
	<body>Pete Perkins (Tommy Lee Jones) is the foreman of a small town to the South of Texas, on the border with Mexico, which decides to investigate the death of his friend, Melquiades Estrada (Julio César Cedillo), work that will lead to "hijack" the guilty party, Mike Norton (Barry Pepper), and force him to cross the border with him to bury his friend. While the overview might seem uninteresting, perhaps maybe the tape is the script.Great debut in the direction by Tommy Lee Jones, who also also complies correctly no less important role in the movie. The screenwriter for the film, Guillermo Arriaga, known for writing the screenplays of Amores Perros and 21 grams, shows us his particular touch to telling us the story with this series of "temporary"leaps"that already accustomed us.From what the flame "First burial" until "The trip", the film may err on the side of lack of depth, because the viewer wondered what is what is intended us to say, teach, stress. However, is then, in the beginning of the journey, when the film begins to take ease, but also strength: it deepens the relationship between Perkins and Norton, shows the daily life of a border basis between Mexico and the us.Surely the film will be history as one of the best, and can reach seem slow pace. However, the performance and direction of Tommy Lee Jones (speaking Spanish with accent Mexican.) and the screenplay of Guillermo Arriaga become worthy of mention and observation tasks (not in vain, won their respective awards at the Cannes Festival).PS: Must see original version (mixture of dialogues in English and Spanish)</body>
