	<summary>As often happens, the fact that script and direction appeals on the same person help that the viewer has the feeling of being before a circle closes without leaving fissures.</summary>
	<body>Directed by Martha Fiennes and performed by an impressive cast, headed by his brother Ralph Fiennes, Ben Chaplin and Kristin Scott Thomas, among others, comes to Spanish cinema screens high Sociedad.Este film is an Anglo-French co-production whose plot revolves around the life of a traditional family and high London rank who sees threatened its darkest secrets in a world in which the surname isn't important enough to get respect a society acting moved by economic interests and a modus vivendi imported from the Unidos.A States despite that its important duration (exceed more than two hours) they could make something heavy, the impeccable direction and agility in the development of his script get that at any moment the viewer experience feeling of boredom or boredom. In this aspect, it is necessary to stress the importance of the fact that direction and screenplay belong to the same person, which allows a perfect Assembly between the two fields of production. In the interpretative aspect, magnificent Fiennes, Ian Holm and Kristin Scott, rather than correct Ben Chaplin and acceptable (already is enough in it), Penelope Cruz. In any case, on this occasion we have a quality product, that performs a deep analysis of the prevailing social psyche and the existing interrelations between different levels of the apparently rigid and stiff British urban bourgeoisie. For all these reasons, high society is a good characteristically European on the Cadence in his developing film and that the perfect combination of entertainment and quality.</body>
