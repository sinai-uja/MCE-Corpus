	<body>Guillermo del Toro's latest film, "El laberinto del Fauno" excuse in the confrontation between the Francoist army and the maquis hidden in the mountains (although you could be anywhere else), to narrate the trip undertaken by the girl Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) to a magical world of fairies, fauns and monsters. This trip makes Ophelia is done away from their sad reality, with her dead father, and his mother Carmen (Ariadna Gil), pregnant, on his arrival in the village where this outstanding Captain Vidal (Sergi López), true OGRE function.The film has a great visual invoice, with recurring aesthetic elements in the film of del Toro, and without a doubt it is his best film (along with "Cronos"), but contains too many edulcorados moments, and even though there are some point of explicit violence, does not mean to avoid the child and predictable tone of the story. In his idea of creating a story for adults stays halfway, in a tale childrens somewhat sadistic (MTV generation and others).The best are findings Visual that bull we are accustomed, the good done in setting, make-up and effects, good transitions between reality and fantasy and marvelous interpretation of Sergi López (the best actor Spanish with difference). Even if it runs halfway is a nice proposal, far from being the work teacher that it pregonaba (and be obsequious) but can be enjoyed without pretensions and not bored.</body>
