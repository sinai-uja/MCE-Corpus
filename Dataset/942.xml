	<summary>Film of pseudo-scientific and criminal action that makes it imperative to leaving the brain at home. As you do like me and you questions everything that happens, it will end and you'll still saying "man masters".</summary>
	<body>Gordo is Van Kilmer, my mother, if almost not fit onto the plane. And this is not to mention the clone of Fernando Alonso coming out trying to sanity the screenplay of science fiction which has the film. By the way, it leaves vu it must post that molará them the expression, given that the tape has nothing to do with leaves them vus, right?The film is a brutal attack suffered by the city of New Orleans, still recovering from the blow of Hurricane Katrina. A ferry full of military exploits causing half thousand victims. A police officer who is in charge of the case finds a body, found an hour before the explosion which seems to have died in the same. Pulling the thread, it comes to be recruited by a group of the Government which seems to have the power of days earlier, see what happened exactly four and a half days.Well, not be good to say. I can with the flying Chinese films, with the Martians, with superheroes, etc, but with them claiming to be serious and kicking the elementary physics, I cannot. And that happened to me with this. The entire film is based on the happy machine that shows us the happened days ago and there is a moment in which the thing is despendola and I do not think anything serious. Then they talk about travel in time and already I repatean. For the rest, is a tape of action with some explosions and perhaps camouflaged by a somewhat light police investigation. It is not very bad, but I can not with her.In short, explanations and criminal action which makes essential film left brain at home. As you do like me and you questions everything that happens, it will end and you'll still saying "man masters".</body>
