	<summary>Intolerable cruelty. So surreal and tronchante as hard and geek. If you have not seen are taking as much as I do not see his new movie!</summary>
	<body>Despite being on vacation I've been a very productive week and I have not seen yet the second feature film by Santiago Lorenzo, something which I will do shortly. I used a little free to get MOM this is boba, a movie that does not have too many differences with the films of Wes Anderson and Todd Solondz. Her remembered it cruel and it is, it is of balls. Toribio and gem are the parents of Martin, a kid with problems at school. They live in Palencia and are, in their own way, happy.A good day local TV appears in their lives and starts the nightmare. Eduardo Antuña front of an absolutely delivered cast, the good and the bad. Funny narration of Martin and mention that party for the Orchestra of the Festival, or Todd Phillips would have been able to.So surreal and tronchante as hard and geek. If you have not seen are taking as much as I do not see his new movie! If not you made clear, the movie is a punch in the lower abdomen, but absolutely necessary.</body>
