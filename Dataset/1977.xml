	<summary>The fleeting appearance of the own Chaplin as a dizzy bartender - a cameo by only ten seconds to the sumo - does not become or even only thing salvageable from this pastiche. Slow curtain.</summary>
	<body>The Countess of Hong Kong are already few traits, only vestiges of the great filmmaker who was Charles Spencer Chaplin. At the beginning, the conundrum of the doors open and the exaggerated flight, or only in the gestures of a correct Sophia Loren in his role; We are Charles and his genius.Sitcom, choral, anachronistic and failed from all points of view; shot up with a certain color off, so weary as the own script and the tasteless unjustified cameos of the family Chaplin.Grandes faults in assembling, unimaginable in an artist with the dedication and the past, for example, that Sophia Loren (said the best away from the film) change from one scene to another not only hairstyle, but hair color?, revealing a great artist in a stage, say to be good, senile.!The constant fights - and indifference - during filming between the protagonists, accentuates the grim fame of the film. During a dance in the ocean liner, the best sentence occurs: "Dad says that it is should love everyone, less the Communists."The fleeting appearance of the own Chaplin as a dizzy bartender - a cameo by only ten seconds to the sumo - does not become or even only thing salvageable from this pastiche. Slow curtain.Summary: Last film of Chaplin, also shot in England. This time in technicolor and cinemascope, with two dazzling stars of the moment. A diplomat newly appointed millionaire (Marlon Brando), falls for a polizonte dancer in a cabaret in Hong Kong (Sophia Loren) during the course of the trip by boat toward the us. Major box office failure.</body>
