	<body>Wonderful, fabulous, fantastic and impressive. But also violent, cruel, heartbreaking and sad. Since then it is not a tale for children, but a tale for adults as strong as sensitive. Tells the arrival of a girl and her mother to a rural House, occupied by the Pro-Franco army of post-war Spanish in order to hunt and exterminate the maquis of the area. The pregnant mother and girls come to the House to be closer to the stepfather of the girl child (husband of the mother and captain of the troops installed in the House) at the time of the birth of his son. Meanwhile attended a fantasy story that is found in the imagination of the girl, whose purpose is to escape from the horrible outside world where war and death campan at your leisure, but that in certain moments appears even more terrifying than reality itself.Ariadna Gil is the mother and the girl is played by Ivana Baquero. Both are good in the movie, but I would like to highlight the performance of Maribel Verdú as the housekeeper in the House, and Alex Angulo as doctor in the area. Special mention needs Sergi López, whose composition of Captain Vidal creates a monster thousand times more terrifying than any of those who can live in the imagination of the girl, and deserving nominations and awards several in all festivals, Goyas, Oscars and several Ariels who chooses this film.Do not need to say that the film is also flawless technical and artistically speaking: music, photography, design of the fantasy world, the script, the pace? everyone deserves these five stars that Crown a Director, Guillermo del Toro, who already pointed out good ways and who has now earned the mention of master, which does masterpieces.</body>
