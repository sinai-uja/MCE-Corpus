	<body>Taking advantage of the premiere of the third part of the saga, I bring you a "remember" of the previous two. So you can see that I am a guy nice and rolled. That views once again, I realized that already seen had. UM, that isn't anything good for a movie, if it goes through your retina and brain assimilates nothing thereon.The film is about a boat of fishermen found on the high seas to a sea bream with aspect of human being. After rescuing him from the water and seeing it has a couple of bullets in the back, the boy stands, with a strong amnesia, but with knowledge in languages, and other martial arts. To arrive at port, the boy goes to a bank whose review took her into the hip and there discovers that he has thousands of dollars and hundreds of passports with different names. But nothing to tell you who he is.Since then, this first installment brings us the hand as it increases the intrigue to know who is our Bourne. Pity that the film ends and leave no doubt, but well, does not pass anything. The film has enough action, not all that deseariamos, but an acceptable level. The plot is quite well, which makes a film of these that we must see before you die popcorn fans, clear.In short, first installment of the Bourne saga, with a secret agent who fights to regain his memory, and that leave you in peace. A fair level of action and an appropriate intrigue make two hours too long.kisses.</body>
