	<body>This is the film that would have signed the Coen brothers, if you have been born around here. Or it is the movie to which a Camilo José Cela had put his signature as a screenwriter, i.e. much of this opera prima of moderate gruesomeness and provincial tragedies of all life.I've also seen David Lynch: as these characters of blue velvet to fatigue the streets in search of redemption and that at the end, it is located in the desolation of his life paradise that sell the pulpits and sell them you ketubim home. Cabezudo outlines the ochre of the deep Spain, that tristísimo color that scale the walls and devours the green roofs without compassion. It is the Spain ever seen outlined in the stale iconography of some past not necessarily remote, reconstructed, here, invested in an oppressive liturgy.Actors embroider the characters, which are extreme, and clustered around a tour of complex narrative force that, on occasions, can mislead the viewer little accomplice. Just agree that the chapters on which is mounted the script belong to a thread necessarily go, but strict, useful, without cracks.To be a masterpiece, which some would like to fly our learned thriller national, if so we want to call it, need you a less bombastic tone. The magnificence of the feelings that populate the film not drink in the drama of Shakespeare but nutritious corpus of rural folk tradition. If Lynch saw it, her would be yours. And that is a huge compliment.</body>
