	<body>"An adventurer and a woman try to find a treasure hidden somewhere in the Brazil." "They are not the only ones who want to achieve and so are ready to everything."Very entertaining tape of action-adventure, one of the first of this type later starred the great Jean Paul Belmondo in abundant quantities. Thereby lost a great dramatic actor (which it was, as it demonstrated more than once), although viewers spend it pump with spectacular feats. This before us is enjoyable while it looks, and later forgettable, but it contains a frenetic pace that makes you pass it superbly.In addition, there are beautiful landscapes, as it corresponds to the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro, and other beautiful locations. A very enjoyable movie.</body>
