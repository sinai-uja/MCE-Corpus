	<body>It is an extreme difficulty to recover through fiction, the story of a tragedy that was narrated in real time by the televisions around the world and whose images have been massively assimilated by our media iconography. Paul Greengrass for their own vision of September 11 reduces the possibilities to matching the only valid, which means the Chronicle of what happened that day, without more implications than the pay homage to the victims; which tells the story of United 93, the only hijacked plane that did not reach its United 93 objetivoDe you could say that in a sense is a species of making off on what CNN could count; why in detriment of the visible, it being perpetrated in the bowels of the bases of operations in the Flight 93. Greengrass dissects the film with tension and clinical spirit, so to progress, without losing nerve or falling into morbid, go win in emotion and above all an anguish it seems our.
