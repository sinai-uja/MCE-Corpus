	<body>Dennis Quaid, a good actor so untapped as Kurt Russell stars in this story of second chances perfectly directed by John Lee Hancock (to his credit the wonderful script for A perfect world) and masterfully written by Mike Rich, apparently expert in histories of the same nature.The history of The Rookie (rookie) can not be simpler and more trite: Jimmy Morris is a child whose military father does more than change of residence for business reasons, but they come to Texas to stay. Jimmy is passionate about baseball and there there is little interest in the sport. However he still practiced and eventually became a Professor of Sciences and coaches the baseball team of the Institute. But a good day reaches an agreement with his students to enable them to earn one minor league. And that will change your life and will be given a second opportunity could never expect.Many will see the typical Yankee history "bigger than life", as it is based on real events. But the screenplay, dialogues and interpretations are the very best and do a reality may seem even a great piece of fiction. Was a large jewel which I adueñaré as soon as you find a dvd.¿Million Dollar Baby a film about boxing? The same goes for it and baseball. Highly recommended. To highlight the music of Carter Burwell, who on more than one occasion wears (Fargo, conspiracy) and on which I will do a small post to add a couple of wonderful songs.</body>
