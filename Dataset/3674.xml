	<body>Hitman is the film adaptation of the popular game designed by the Danish company IO interactive, which has become already a series of several deliveries since its launch in the year 2000 of Hitman: codename 47.Dirigida by Frenchman Xavier Gens, director of the film presented in the Festival de Sitges Frontiere (s) past, and starring Timothy Olyphant, Dougray ScottRobert Knepper and Olga Kurylenko among others, the film tells the story of a Hitman known only as 47, whose mission is to end the purposes designated by the enigmatic grouping known as the Agency. During a mission in Russia, 47 will be victim of an ambush, becoming the target of the other Hitman.Como due to the shortage of scripts that is decimating the originality of Hollywood for a few years, adaptations of video games, comic books and remakes, have become a sort of goose that lays the golden eggs for the producers: movies like Resident Evil, Alone in the dark, Silent Hill, Tomb Raider or House of the dead flooded the screens more and more frequently, with quite mixed, although generally not too flattering results.Well, Hitman is a clear example of this.With a relamido script, performances of the 1980s telefilm, and alleged explicit violence that has made the film to reach United States with an inexplicable R, Hitman classification is not because it offers no novelty to the gender thing which nor expected, but is not even able to distract us fairly; Neither slowed cameras, enhanced levels, nor the constant gunfire accompanied by industrial music nor shoestring dresses of Olga Kurylenko are able to deliver us from a torpor that is beginning to be alarmingly tangible reality to the fifteen minutes of footage.It is not a server find tremendously convoluted plot, nor much less a few interpretations of Oscar, but fun and action fast-paced, with elaborate and stunning special effects, such and as other products current as the jungle 4.0 or even Shoot' em up Yes we offer.But Hitman not.Nor its choreography and its flat continuous slow-motion fail approaching John Woo more decadent, its history we sounds like déjà vu, or better said, rehash, and Timothy Olyphant is still less credible in his role of villain in the jungle 4.0; exempt from charisma, the killer 47 number parading by Russia and Turkey with its unmistakable bar code tattooed in the neck without being seen - to quote just one of several inconsistencies found along its plot-busting agents of the mafia, Interpol, or Russian intelligence, as well as other Hitman, so neat as bland wayoffering only a few exaggerated jets of hemoglobin.Quite tedious, to tell the truth.I give it a 4 out of 10.</body>
