	<summary>When a historical film pass historical accuracy by the nose, it is frankly difficult to concentrate on the other.</summary>
	<body>The Indian director Shekhar Kapur brings us the sequel to Elizabeth, masterfully played by Cate Blanchett overflowing to build this character, by providing it with the claw and magnetism that the historical figure deserves. I have to say that if something worth this film is only to see Cate in so beautiful exercise because it in essence, the film is failed.When a historical film pass historical accuracy by the nose, it is frankly difficult to concentrate otherwise, true is that locations and costumes are notable but honestly the story has many black holes. If you are a gourmets of history, believe me, you'll like.Mention the role of Jodi Moll√° little gives us to enjoy.Cate accompanies a most interesting Clive Owen that after "Children of men" seems to have made an accurate jump on the starsystem Hollywood, but whose interpretation in this film is not and if you want to need to speak for his character like the rest are a mere adornment of the character of Cate which is which carries the entire weight of the narrative pulse.</body>
