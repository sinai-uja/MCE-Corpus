	<body>This film is a failed and pathetic "attempt" to do something similar to the great saga of "Saw" Cutre-Luxe version. The director Roland Joffé (which prepares Singularity for 2008), presents this crappy as something "Trangresor" but in reality leaves muchisisisisimo to be desired. The argument has no feet or head and pisco games have nothing, are rather predictable, facilones. The interpretive cast is composed mostly by far side actors in his acting career.To Daniel Gillies you recall because the bridegroom is marine Chirsten Dunst in Spider-man, this is the most notable of this guy, whose interpretation is forced, little organic and nothing credible, but will the girl, Elisha Cuthbert, fuuuuu, it is so but so bad that almost get me a spasm in the middle of the film. In conclusion, if you don't want to waste your time and your money goes from this film papupérrimo. It is amazing as it continues still wasting budget in these shit movies, having both young director with talent that surely it would better.</body>
