	<body>"If you give up in winter, you've lost spring, summer and autumn".Absolutely dismal social realist film. It is the best option to go directly to the psychiatrist to ask a good dose of prozac. Certainly the intention of the Director "that cold soul cale you" is achieved. I'm particularly not fond of this film genre, I always say that to see outside misfortunes already I have the news and so my soul was cale, my own life and the things that I want to. This type of film is unnecessary and contributes to the engricesimiento of society. In addition the only thing memorable isn't Mercedes Sampietro. That ugly actors, mother of God who so depressing that grey decorádos more absolute. The script will be very winning but love to Jesus Christ that the film cannot be more bodriosa and more sad. Actresses with greasy hair and bad hair (intention I guess to emphasize further the deprimencia) and Silvia Munt wrinkled as a dump of the carrefour and silicone lips getting ready to burst. The interpretation by known actors (Mercedes, Silvia.) very well and some secondary to vomit.</body>
