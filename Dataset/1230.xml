	<body>There are many concepts of heroes in the film. The Supermen with costumes and real heroes uniforms without facemasks are or super-nombres. This is the case of firefighters.Their dedication and commitment is commendable, because his work is risking his life to save others and perform tasks, sometimes, in extreme danger. Why is always welcome "Guild" films such as these, which reflects everyday heroes with some proximity.Brigade 49 is a tribute film; much "deeper" than flares. Although both are fiction, the film by Jay Russell is "Biographical" and much more realistic than the Ron Howard, who is based in the Guild of firefighters but introduces a somewhat forced research plot but no less interesting.This film tells the trajectory of a Rookie Firefighter (Joaquin Phoenix) in the Brigade commanded by John Travolta. At his side, partners such as Robert Patrick, etc? a gang of dedicated fire fighters who risk their lives in fires and other disaster situations. The film focuses on an accident suffered by the character of Phoenix during a fire and tells their progress to professional and personal as a flashback.Despite some jokes that there are kind and thrilling moments in the film, the film is boring. Complies with the share of tribute and professional claim to a people with his work running more risks than the be dismissed, but lacks it passion film, be at the height of these heroes.Why the film continues to be entertaining decentillo but very bland.</body>
