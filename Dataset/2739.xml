	<summary>Approved by the hairs and the soundtrack, because the last 20 minutes are very poor. Could that the American comedy is bottoming it be?</summary>
	<body>Todd Phillips is of my tea. First because I like Road Trip more sympathetic to American Pie, second, because Old School is the closest thing to Animal House that I've done in the last decade and third because Starsky &amp; Hutch worked in the end.School for pringá I (memorable again the Lord of translations) is a failed attempt of wild comedy because it is so comedy nor is as wild as expected of team Phillips-Armstrong, almost infallible to date.The movie is not a pain in the ass, but is long (107 minutes of comedy are many even for Virgin at 40) and it does not have the necessary amount of good gags for that duration, only on the balls of painting and the joke with Moby stick out from the rest.Heder should begin to select their roles a little because if not going you to happen so that a Thornton that here seems to play the same role as in the imminent Mr.Woodcock. Despite all this year Heder has made an ideal partner with Will Ferrell in Blades of Glory. A little too bland.Approved by the hairs and the soundtrack, because the last 20 minutes are very poor.PS: do could be that American comedy is bottoming, does no one to seen the awful trailer for last of the Farrelly??</body>
