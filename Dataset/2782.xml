	<body>Well, nothing, the case becomes myth and the second part we have here. As you can see, the director has changed (anda that apellidar green grass has balls) and has also changed the lead actress for reasons unknown. I preferred the previous one (in the physical plane, I mean).The film is about a secret agent who has lost memory, and following a withdrawal of 2 years in the ass of the world, have to deal with a had that even colea. On the other hand, he has been involved in a crime he did not commit, so average CIA pursues him like crazy.The second part of Mr Bourne has much more action, which counteracts the perfection with the loss of intrigue. I.e., if we know that he has lost the memory and Intuit who is, because that is lost. But it has been known to give a dose of great action and special effects to make the two-hour bearable. To highlight the final persecution, which is tremendous.In short, second installment of our friend Bourne, who has to travel the world to avenge a had, in addition to escape from his past that is increasingly closer. Lots of action and an argument solid enough to make us an entertaining two hours.</body>
