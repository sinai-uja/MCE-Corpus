	<body>"Crank" is one of those movies that could comment on with only a sentence or two; even with a word or two. But before doing so, I will put in background.I went to the movies with the best of the biases, waiting for a film of pure evasion in the style of "The Transporter". A tape to enjoy without more, with cinema and history just to make it entertaining and an actor, Jason Statham, who has some charisma for this type of roles. Nothing more.That is what I was looking for. What I found was an insult to the Viewer, silly plot (even though the premise, without being original, was at least interesting for an action film), shot by a pair of types that have no idea how are wheel a scene of action, decide to shoot from 20 different angles (blessed digital cameras) to be able to stun the public. "That they can not offer film, nor the bad, they offer a game.""Crank" has some of the most embarrassing scenes I've seen in a film. An ideal movie for those who see the film with a single hand or the brain medium gas. I know that all you ever do (about the brain, say) but this is too much.In short, returning to what I said at the beginning, "Crank" is a real hodgepodge that is better to flee. Final rating: 0 out of 10</body>
