	<summary>A B movie Spanish, made with limited means but that manages to maintain the interest of the Viewer, despite their obvious technical poverty.</summary>
	<body>Look where it is now that I'm on vacation in the newspaper, has occurred to me, since my exile conile√±o volunteer, get to see films of the so-called serie B, but with the particularity of being the 1970s Spanish. In this way I came to me with a title that brings together almost all the characteristics of the genre. Namely: blood, guts, shouts, spirits and other things I will surely forget. They could not miss, being Spanish, their majestic female teaching a bit of pechuguilla and muslamen.The attack of the dead without eyes, who thus baptized to the creature in 1973, based on a base which is curiously today cutting today, as the lynching of an entire people is the Knights Templar who lived in a monastery in the area, because of alleged heretics and demonic practices which developed. Centuries later, will return from their graves to raze the village.Obviously, from the technical point of view, the film leaves a lot to be desired, although the story is not bad and has some interest, so it does not become so decadent as the subgenus Z. It also contributes to this outstanding interpretation of Fernando Sancho, along with the rest of the cast contributing to alleviate, in good part, the extreme poverty of the special effects.Without reaching the height of other films of the genre such as the fall of the House of Usher, the attack of the dead without eyes is an acceptable film useful for the entertainment and which might well envy many of the decadent productions that nowadays flood movie theaters.</body>
