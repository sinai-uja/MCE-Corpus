	<body>The second film Martha Fiennes as Director does not convince the criticism and will have to wait until its premiere on 18 may, to know if it convinces the Spanish public. In 2005 this film closes Cannes Film Festival and has had to wait, for reasons that the own Director known until 2007 for power release in movie theaters. As a curious note, will debut soon in Spain than in the Kingdom Unido.Martha Fiennes tells existential vacuum in refined and stiff high English society through the life of a lawyer of success (Damian Lewis) and his wife (Kristin Scott Thomas), an art dealer. However, all the narrative approach is bombastic, abusing in excess of planning was let go by the grandeur of the environments and an excessively high soundtrack.Not noted any actor and our Penelope makes waters as regards credibility incarnating the role of a luxury prostitute coming less troubled cancer. It like all those fans of "Pe" and "The English patient" because repeated the couple protagonist of this film on this, from a subsidiary relationship this time.</body>
