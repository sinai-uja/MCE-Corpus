	<body>If ever someone speaks badly of my directorial debut will mean several things, among them has been released, which is cause for celebration in this our country.Forest of shadows, the much anticipated directorial debut of Koldo Serra (very highly recommend mother's love, I like more than the winning Witch's train) is halfway between the tribute and personal debut.A story that does not exist, characters that do not know and a resolution without claw and cold do not help to improve the work.Positive aspects for example, Oldman and Considine are well (which not very) Homar has a role with many secrets and intricacies that unfortunately we will not ever know.I don't know, expected me something more of claw and a bit more of chicha, notably paragraph SPOILER and trigger of "la movida".Anyway, despite its flaws, I am sure that Serra will make something very big in the near future.</body>
