	<body>The proposal for this year of France to the Oscars is going to make it very difficult for the film "ordinary", while presenting an animated film was already risky, do with Persepolis is even more controversial. Based on a graphic novel by Marjane Satrapi with clear autobiographical vocation. The Ribbon is a social and political criticism of the political reality that lived Iran and continues to live today from the experience of Marjane, a girl that will grow with the change of regime and seeing how this affects her family, friends and relationships. From their own country of origin and from exile will change your way of looking at life. Discover the music, love, repression, fear, the role of women, totalitarian regimes and take correct and incorrect decisions always supported by a family that her educates and protects.Some argue that the candor of the children is the best mirror to appreciate a story that children are not able to judge or control the story. I think that normally it is not true that the vision of the child only justified as the kid to behave and not the reaction of the Viewer to what is infant alive. This tape is a clear example of this. Persepolis is a round film to get a decent balance between the doctrinal content and action. His aesthetic, fully adapted from the comic strip to the screen is just balanced, effects and Illustrator. Despite the clear prejudices that had before seeing her I must admit that Persepolis has been a revelation and one of the animated films more advisable I've seen aimed at adult audiences.</body>
