	<body>Apparently one of the most sobados subgenera of the genus of the horror named SLASHER that almost works as a genre at your own pace with the same topics always but always acceptable blockbuster results achieved.A new way of approaching the terror was created from the successes in the 70 and 80 films such as "The night of Halloween" or "Friday the 13th".It was as if the action was in a residential neighborhood, school, summer camp. An unknown killer butchered to adolescents without much brain.With doses of GORE, sex, a bit of black humor, her formula is repeated reaching in many films the ridiculous.Here the action takes place in an Institute, crossing some samples of the latest hits of the genre as "Rumors that kill" or "You want to tell you a secret" with the SLASHER of always.You little comment of completely unknown actors and a director who faces his first film. However what one expected as simple bait, he ends up encountering a well shot film where the protagonists for once have some charisma, especially the two protagonists.A much better elaborate script that in this type of production are carried out, all of this with an elegant address that manages to keep you in suspense without liters of blood or topless.</body>
