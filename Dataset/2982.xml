	<body>Rivers of life juice have been spilled over the thousands of screenings of this film, rivers that reach the sea of life from which was born the Mediterranean. If when you cut the Woodpecker that God of Mythology was something like this, why not can be this true? Separate grumosidades, in the memory of my adolescent mind, the pool full of "fishes" that make my most fevered imagination. To the mess.The film is about Caligula, Roman Emperor seeing what rocks be, killed his predecessor as well as not wanting to. Once on the throne, he focuses on Vice and perversion, gaining thousands of enemies and the people who love him. To blow Dick elapses the film, that has nothing, but as they go in every scene people in balls, then becomes very animadita.Penthouse was which put the pasta to make this semi pornographic film, that without having neither feet nor head wins the favor of the criticism (at least of the mia). Vice and perversion of the Lord, than anything more start gives a meneito his sister to dip bread and churro, let us dream with other periods where the orgies were the daily bread. My mother, Roman Emperor, all-day dale you hit. See Julio Cesar, who killed him until his son and without being all day pushing as a lion. Much more ready this Calígula. By the way, that crazy face has this boy.In short, film pornographic semi on the life of the Roman emperor Caligula, who devoted all his efforts to Vice setting aside politics and the sanity of step. To refine the zambomba without more.Caligula, with your purse brown skin and its cojón skin shoes. (Was the first version of Serrat)kisses.</body>
