	<body>Impressive documentary of the German director who tells the late Timothy Treadwell, a freak who spent thirteen years among bears, making the streams. Almost all of the footage is video file of this character, who wanted to live among his brothers bears denying the man who hated.He died torn apart and devoured by a bear that did not want to make friend with his wife. At the beginning of the documentary, we believe that the such Treadwell was a nice guy seeking twinning with nature, but as they pass the minutes almost us we identify most (including the director) with those who claimed that he was like a watering can. I've seen is a portrait of a sunken man (attention to the key that gives his own father in the interview with Herzog) lost the head with drugs and drink. Moments of superhuman beauty, as the first contact with the Fox, go hand in hand of others really frightening (from the statements of the coroner to the duel of bears, the sequence of the fateful attack, including Herzog shivering is to listen to the audio track, recorded in the House of the victim) to achieve the best documentary of the year and probably one of the three best movies. 9.</body>
