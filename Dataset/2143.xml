	<summary>Small, nice and funny production, with a peculiar and unusual sense of humor, and a huge Morgan Freeman that passes it big with a Paz Vega makes juggling with his accent.</summary>
	<body>In '10 Items Or Less' (sorry, I refuse to call it as her "translated" in these parts), Morgan Freeman embodies a famous actor in low hours is forced to accept a role in an independent film about a supermarket manager. To be able to investigate on his character, visit a supermarket in a working class district of Los Angeles, where known to Scarlet (Yes, with a t), the energetic cashier starring Paz Vega. Between the two will emerge a peculiar relationship that will learn something from the other.Let's say that this film is a kind of ' Lost in Translation 2' that takes place in Los Angeles. Apparently does not resemble anything, but at the most basic, the motivations and the relationship between the couple protagonist, could well be sisters. This is the least, unless it has its own personality, and is forgiven.Best thing about this film is that you don't have any claim, it has a peculiar and unusual sense of humor, is very small and it is quite nice and fun, once you enter in your game, clear. Because of the way in which it is told (the gafapastis will love) will be a film quite misunderstood, unfortunately. In addition, the two actors are quite well: a huge Morgan Freeman that passes big together to a Paz Vega juggling her accent. And on screen they have much "spark" and work very well. Recommended and warm comedy, if only to hear Morgan Freeman to sing "pasar la barca" (in VOSE, of course).Also does not neither long nor heavy, because lasts a sigh: an hour and twenty. Just enough and long enough. something that, unfortunately, seem to have forgotten much of filmmakers.</body>
