	<body>At this stage of the game nobody will wait to see a normalita movie right? I must confess I follower of the series and deeply disappointed with the 2nd delivery, which seemed pathetic not to mention the infumable peleita with the motorcycle-style Power Rangers.Pero to those who like me were left with bad taste in the mouth, I have to encourage them to see the 3rd part is very but very well.Let's see gentlemen, if you are going to see any of deliveries of I do not expect to find films "Real" that this kind of Screen Play has a lot of fantastic. This is a caption that I have addressed all the buds that went to the premiere of MI-II in the "Palacio de la Música" (Madrid) and did not stop laughing and make comments on high such as "come fuck thats a fantasmada". OK friends, will be a fantasmada or not, but what is certain is that if I want to see social realism I'm going to see "The Monday a Sun" and not a film, commercial, product of masses and we already know that it is highly exaggerated.That said, I come: MI - III which fortunately not directed the Sr.Woo. It is perhaps the most human of the three installments. The actors are all very well. Descrubrimos part one time more, repeat, "Humana" of the IMF (impossible mission force) Agency and since then we discover the true side of our prota (already it was time) which is very interesting and novel. Heads that are wrong, the value of friendship (as beautiful), the struggle for an ideal.I did not like anything the beginning type Tarantino that what happens when this kind of technique is not used well is that you get a crappy, which is in my opinion what is loaded you movie and when you see her you know why. But in general and in the style of the series, I think this is the best of the three.</body>
