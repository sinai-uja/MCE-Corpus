	<body>Credits and featured Donald Sutherland among a lot of Chinese names that you do not recognize? And the film is entitled "The funeral of the head"?You're still looking to see what it is.Then follows a sequence of a laboring, but it is a shooting. And see Donald who is the director: are in Beijing during a shoot. But he feels empty, disappointed and depressed because he has failed to do anything decent in what takes of filming. Filming is delaying and producer decides to withdraw to Donald and bring to another but maintaining the first in the opening credits as claim, something what Sutherland (from now Tyler) refuses. And in the midst of all this problem, veteran director befriends the camera is doing the "making of"(Yo-Yo) just before suffering a heart attack.The last words of the filmmaker are: want a comical funeral.From there begins the surrealism. Tyler is a great director who is diagnosed to die soon, but want a great show in his death.From there reveals the talent for advertising and business I-Yo.Y of all the paraphernalia that is mounted from that event.This film could frame her or grouped into those who play with a surreal screenplay and have fun at the border of the ridiculous (in this case without crossing it). It could be sold in pack with "Strange coincidences" (absolute hodgepodge) and "Anonymous". Very interesting to see except for some time lacking in pace and some very stretched situation.But we can not forget something: this is a Chinese film. An interesting Chinese experiment.</body>
