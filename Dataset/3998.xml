	<body>Alex of the Church adapted the famous novel of Argentine Guillermo Martínez in a film that pretends to be another attempt of international shuttle after the nonsense that turned out to be PERDITA DURANGO. So the filmmaker surrounds two interpreters prestigious with the young face of ELIJAH WOOD that does not eat a thread from the Ring trilogy, accompanies the veteran and unforgettable star of man elephant JHON HURT, female presence rests with the Spanish Leonor WATLING so sexy as always, seen in our cinema hits as they are sea or talk to her.It is certainly an order where Alex practically denies his label that characterizes him to sign his film academic and less risky. Similar in some respects to the DA VINCI code though it may be much more entertaining, is a Thriller of the lot where we miss cynical humor or bad milk present in other works of the Basque, nothing to do with the community and the day of the beast for example although you must assess you in its fair measure. That is a well served dish where there's the long enigmas, suspicion and numerous dangers that makes you have a good time without great pretensions.We will see that as it works on the international market which is where mostly going for this product.Technically notable in all its aspects, performers are no more.</body>
