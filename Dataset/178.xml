	<summary>What would he that movie that made my dad, the bravest man in the world, left terrified of the room as a soul that leads the devil?</summary>
	<body>My first memory of psychosis is vague, but also shocking. I remember we were veraneando whole family in Almu√±ecar, and while my grandmother looked after us my parents went to see a movie to the movies of summer. When they arrived I heard my mother say that since then I keep in mind: "Dad has had to leave the film". Often childhood trauma, which would have that film, I thought at the time to make that my dad, the bravest man in the world, leaving poor the room as a soul that leads the devil?When I think of psychosis, also comes me to mind a word of difficult definition: art. And also comes me to mind one of the best definitions that have given me on this word. No matter what or how to be when something arouses in you an emotion, that is art. So the head of my school, I said Amen. And this film fits perfectly in this definition, without a doubt a polished jewel of the orondo and convoluted Hitch, art in its purest form of the master of suspense.Needless to talk about scenes, actors and argument, because of psychosis are well known by all. Just there to encourage everyone who see with clean mind, as those people who in the 1960s went to the cinema to enjoy "another" film by the master, as if they had not spent the years and still believed the virginity and the magic of the seventh art. An art which sank in the dark of the human mind and deep slopes without neglecting the more pure entertainment. That which is now called Hollywood.</body>
