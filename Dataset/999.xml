	<body>Under my humble opinion, find it me an almost documentary film to close to the events in the English Royal House under the death of Lady Di, and especially seen from the point of view of the Riena, Isabel Inglaterra.La film is entertaining and interesting, especially for recent events, but when it ended, my feeling was more than an intention, by the creator of the film, to reconcile the public with the image of the monarchy.I will frankly take it as a romantic vision of what could happen by the mind of the monarch after the death of Lady Di, and not what actually happened. In any case I prefer the exceptional interpretation of "Helen Mirren," actress that I was completely unknown until this film.As well as the similar physicist of the Queen is amazing, is very far away the reflection of Prince Charles in the actor who plays him, Alex Jennings. Back that gives the pego, but seen in the face I think improves too present.</body>
