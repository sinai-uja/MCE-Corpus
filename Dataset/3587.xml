	<summary>It will please lovers although no end of Excite.</summary>
	<body>The narrator of this film says that sometimes the story her without the characters, do the landscapes, places. Somehow after watching after midnight is not obliged to give the reason already to Turin, and more specifically the Mole (the Museum of the cinema) a place that seems so magical that any film buff has the need to visit it from the moment that appears on screen for the first time.While I don't agree with experiments of target film in this case I transijo and praise the narration and the ornaments of classic film, Keaton scenarios and corsets of Marilyn Monroe. So curious place develops this tale of love and heartbreak with form of love triangle where Martino, (Giorgio Pasotti, the last Kiss) uncomfortable night guardian of the Museum who lives in the world of silent film with their routines until Amanda just invading his space fleeing from the police after an incident with her boss. The third in discord is Angelo (Fabio Troiano), her official boyfriend but a conflicting type and some badass whose only known work is to steal cars and flirt indiscriminately. Amanda has to hide with Martino and thus will discover the beauty of the Mole and the world of cinema. The Viewer is a sponge that absorbed the beauty of the mind of Martino and the doctrinatica information of his Narrator while the facts are inevitably directed at midnight.It will please lovers although no end of Excite. And as the narrator says: films just but the film ends not never. THE movie data: Won the Caligario award at the Berlin Film Festival recently presented during the international week of film of Valladolid 2004 within the meeting point section.</body>
