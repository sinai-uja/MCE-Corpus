	<body>Bergman began to die when sitting at folios and the pages was born none of his head. When he left to sprout the art of his hands and barely could enjoy what that had filled his life movies, art, books. and it was just music. Thus described Henning Mankell la muerte lenta de this artist, so I read I a few months ago.And perhaps this is why his latest film, its last movement, his requiem has been Saraband. Where music feels, in which everything fits as a Grand Symphony. The structure is simple prologue, epilogue and interspersed ten dialogues with the characteristic of the genius Swedish intensity; with its ability to delve into the human heart; with the extraordinary gift of not show sour or honeyed versions of life, but the fair measure of joyful and sad moments. Pure and absolute intensity exuding all the frames.Worked with the two actors actors, Liv Ullman and Erland Josephson, in secrets of a marriage, the precedent of this film. And not content with this added to BÃ¶rje Ahlstedt and Julia Dufvenius as members of a Quartet of pure and absolute harmony. Because each one of them pushed and strengthened by the passion of a man of eighty years become one with the tragedy, the joy and feel the tear, the smile in her eyes and mouths. Bergman and its close-ups of those Swedish eyes blue and endless moves and moves; Bergman with that wonderful game of light and shadows as nobody enters the human heart throbbing.Congratulations teacher, you're where you closed your work with this absolute master piece. Every note, chord and eighth note set in the right place.</body>
