	<body>The Imperial Spain of the 17TH century, Diego Alatriste, courageous soldier in the service of his Majesty, combat in a war in the cold lands of Flanders. During an ambush by the Dutch, Balboa, friend and companion in arms, wounded death. Alatriste heard from the lips of his friend a last request and promises to comply with it: will take care of his son Iñigo and turn away you from the craft of soldier.Presented under the stupid sanbenito of being the most expensive film of the Spanish film, starring an excellent enlenco production continues to be 2 hours long and heavy in my life, moreover, during much of the footage I mattered 3 hell was going to move on to "our hero", the film becomes dull, tedious, boringsimple, with dialogues that provoke laughter (the question of Pilar López de Ayala to Malatesta.), and some things that did not believe them anyone, I'm glad I no longer carried away by my cinephilia and have I done with the books of Arturo Pérez Reverte before, but now, and after having seen the movie, honestly I have no desire; true it is that the locker room, photography and even the sound and the characterization of the characters is excellent, but this stupid idea of wanting to Peck of all the novels (as I understand), has been a disservice to the tape.In short, who had wanted to but I was disappointed about the way.</body>
