	<summary>Irregular science fiction film.</summary>
	<body>Second of the adventures of the hero do? Riddick, which began its journey in the entertaining series B "Pitch Black".Here, along with the character we have very different facts, i.e., it is not a continuation but that simply takes advantage of the same character to tell another thing, although, logically, David Twohy, its creator, continually makes reference to his past (viewing even scenes from Pitch Black) for showing their evolution and their origin, their origin.In"Chronicles", note that you there are more budget, and is used above all in the art direction and special effects. Normal in this genre.The art direction is irregular, take advantage even (found me me) decorated the first. But the interiors of the buildings are very achieved.As for the story itself, what to me I am interested in a film, has it all. From moments filled with fantasmadas (one tired a little bit that the protagonist is almost impossible to touch a hair on the fights and if you get it, despite the brutal blows him does not make more than any heridita without importance) and guionísticas inconsistencies to galore, so well filmed scenes with tension and sense of entertainment. All this until you get to a, for my taste, satisfactory end, ambiguous and designed for a third party, of course.Interpretations, broadly speaking, are normal but esforzadas, although seen Thandie Newton is a joy. Always good actress, each prettier movie. To emphasize the dialogues between the character of Newton and her husband, which remind me, and no kidding, shakesperianas pages; and above all to the character of the Purifier. A curious and very nice character exemplary played by Linus Roache.En summary, improved but entertaining, although somewhat chaotic and irregular. Wait (I have no hurry, the truth) the third part.</body>
