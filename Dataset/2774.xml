	<body>You have to fuck. Last night, the Omega Man and I had where to choose and we are left with "Mutants in the University", I suppose that by the title and his horny sonority. Go more horrible sheet. Do not stop sounding songs (seems the same always, by the way) during the 76-minute movie.It is is mounted? in an offensive manner, ná, good actors, roll Troma putting faces on the fly. Best of all is that it has 2 directors! History, has no, because nor storyline is neither good nor bad is bland and there is no joke.I think for the moment I can say, when they ask me what is the worst movie I've seen in my life, that this honor lies in "Mutantes en la Universidad"</body>
