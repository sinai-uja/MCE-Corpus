	<body>"Muriel lives in a fantasy world." "To escape the claustrophobic people which spends the summer, its tedious family and their friends corny, she dives in the catalogues of weddings and on the songs of Abba, waiting to get her Prince charming". Frankly it's a good movie, very well filmed and narrated by P.J. Hogan.With magnificent interpretations of the female protagonist couple (here met the always magnificent Tony Collette), the film follows with interest, given its great human depth, where all the passions are to hurt before knowing the complete happiness.A drama in full-scale, real touch of attention to certain negative aspects of society, not just in search of the happiness of its citizens. The humor and drama you order wisely and the tape is remembered with affection and emotion.Inolvidable unforgettable music, with the best songs of Abba, one of my favorite bands. In addition, the excellent sound of the film helps taste it better.</body>
