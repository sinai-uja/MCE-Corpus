	<body>Juno has left me an taste infinitely better than I expected. In the entry on the nominations to Oscar, her called the Little miss Sunshine of this year, but with that, have nothing in common, except that it is a more or less "independent" comedy - "indies" of these fashionable are now (Little miss Sunshine go no further). In addition, it is much better movie and better written, although that, is less fun, kooky and. but, what I comparing them? Anyway, I left lead.The fact is that found me a lovely film, and did not expect me, the truth. It has caught me completely by surprise. Is a joy to see a film with a story the sea of simple, but which is built around a very good script by Diablo Cody (his first screenplay, his first nomination to the Oscar), of some very good actors (enorm√≠sima and brilliant Ellen Page; what a pity that you have enough crude to win the Oscar for best main actress which is nominated. Although anything is possible), and an even better direction from Jason Reitman (also nominated), which provides a smooth and constantly balanced pace. Something in what paste you a good kick a Little miss. It will be possible? I'm comparing them!In addition, addressing the issue that is, does not fall into demagogues cheap or too recurrent panfletarismos today, which is appreciated. It's just like life itself.Any important to be commented on hits. Well, Yes, sometimes there is the feeling that the history goes lurching to find a destination in particular, and that the resolution of a character could have been better. but nothing serious.Recommended.</body>
