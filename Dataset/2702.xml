	<summary>Funny musical, and that we always complain about the "capacaidismo" of the Spanish film, we will give a small (and also concise) vote of confidence to this tape.</summary>
	<body>When I was in the "The young Jane Austen" press pass I found in the film that this film (directed by Álvaro Begines, vocalist of the mythical "not tread on me that I have flip flops", and that it reserves a small cameo) I went back to re-release, something curious and little given in Spain, come on, I do not know any tape (if someone knows what you tell me now or street forever) which has rereleased after the success at the box office.A musical comedy, "The other side of the bed" which starred, among others a great Lola Herrera (and I do that this woman had "parked and kind" as a TV actress), Raúl Arévalo (a discovery in "dark blue almost black"), Antonio Dechent, and Carlos Alvarez-Novoa.No I can say that I liked, that has not disappointed me, but if it is true that, as you can read in your poster, with lyrics by Eva Hache (have sought people from film and television to put opinions, rather than always critics), leaves you with a smile from ear to ear, and look, now that I'm going through a time a little "plof" does not hurt a film that smart you face and you get a bit of laughter to the front.On the musical side, of course, as I have already said, we are facing that, a musical comedy, highlights from "aserejé", to songs of Camilo sixth or Andrés Calamaro, as well as the relieved "I am rebel" that same applies for a broken for a tattered.Honestly, it is a curious thing, and that we always complain about the "capacaidismo" of the Spanish film, we will give you a small (and also concise) vote of confidence to this tape, incidentally, helped me to discover the Aslandticos, singing the main theme of the film.</body>
