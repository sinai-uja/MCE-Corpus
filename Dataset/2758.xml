	<body>Without news of Sam, so clear. Spider-Man 3 could be directed by Brett Ratner, Tim Story, Mark Steven Johnson. There is no trace of the imagination of Raimi, an original proposal, nor a coherent approach. all about rush and noise, and also it takes 90 minutes to boot.It does not reach the extremes of Batman and Robin, but they have things in common.The first movie of the amazing man spider found me an excellent attempt with a sensational morning that was then lost between software. With the second I took a pleasant surprise: the blows of humor functioned and the characters not desmadraban.Now neither good jokes (only one after the first encentro with Flint Marko) or excellence in the visual section, more of the same but worse, faster, larger: boring. The adult stage of the character has eighth of a E.G.B. dyes A giant, but backwards step. Thomas Haden Church, excellent in a role that needed more footage or a film that needed fewer characters is only saved. Venom? If passing by. The rush are very bad. And the habit of not wearing mask.</body>
