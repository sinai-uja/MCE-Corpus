	<summary>A crossover of 2 typical characters, a bunch of laborers wishing to kill them, a silly argument to the more not being able anything more is needed?</summary>
	<body>If I am sincere project called me not the least, and also did not have an excessive by the film curiosity, although it is true that this summer I've been to keep an eye on the series Alien and predator films for quite some time that I saw, go if exaggeration at least about 10 years old. Without a doubt, make a "Crossover" (mixture of two sagas) with two such emblematic characters of the FOX sci-fi film seemed a sovereign memez and once I saw that idiocy called "Freddy Vs Jason" I had to endure a mixture of torpor and desire to kill more than one. As well, here it almost repeated the same formula, flavored with cinema entertainment or action, as you can call both shapes and is very nearly the same, so we have the aliens if Lieutenant Ripley, look at her I have been throwing less during the hour and 20 min. footage and on the other hand to predators. In the middle to a bunch of suckers who wish that they loaded sooner are simple, stupid and mindless to the more not being able, go of those when you are loading you say!SIIII FIESSSTA! by that look that stupid tiparracos made in this kind of films, there is never any that you feel more or less identified. A soundtrack that blends in equal parts the two sagas, together but not riots music, that if. and a director Paul W.S. Anderson, that perhaps the best thing he has done in his life has been out with Milla Jovovich, why his filmography sucks as much as my socks after a football match room.</body>
