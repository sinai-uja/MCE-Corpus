	<summary>Happens to be one of those "great stories" that emits any weekend evening, some television channel, loaded big stars, as well as budgets, and that with a slight vision, one forgets just as easily with that view.</summary>
	<body>Every year I have the healthy (and almost mandatory custom) to see a good movie to close the year film buff and other good to open it; This year it wasn't so, since, the last movie I saw was "Saw 4" (even taking many others in the bedroom) and yesterday, against all odds, I received the call from some friends to go see "The Golden Compass" tape of which I had no illusions be participant of its listing at the box office, and that the 13 &euro; had to pay to see it (6.50 mine and other so many of my lady wife) came out me of the soul.Although I admit that if the tape is not so terrible as she had predicted criticism, and that, being somewhat benevolent, happens to be one of those "great stories" that emits any weekend evening, some television channel, loaded of big stars and budgets, and that, with a slight vision, one forgets just as easily with that view.The story, as soon slows dry, as it progresses so rapidly that one fails to locate easily, the argument becomes so confused that 4 people we had seen the movie together, to end the slide show each had understood a completely different thing, the tape, waiting to know if they will shoot 2 sequels or no more, leaves many open doors, as it reads will need at least one couple of discs on DVD to close both mess.On the other hand, actors, worth coming out Nicole Kidman (with the same face as in advertisements for Chanel), Daniel Craig (which begin to see with eyes of James Bond.), Dakota Blue Richards, (unbearable girl where they exist), Sam Elliott (does this man not know another role?, Eva Green (was hoping that at some point it out a chest)), but are seen, the vast majority think more on the check that they will charge to give credibility to his role.Both excellent special effects such as digital animations, and is that one takes to realize that at some moments that ve is the result of CGI and not of the real world (bears, cities, etc.) a pity that special effects are one of the few good things of the tape.Incidentally, note I do once again to the parents, this film although it is adventure and for children, has an age of tolerance, and carry children less than 7 years to the film is madness, because the 2 min. they will be fed, they will want to leave the room, do pis, drinking water, etc. Lords potatoes, if you are those who want to go to the movies, leave the kids with the guys (that's what we are), with the grandparents, or any other similar character, and do not give the bara with their offspring to other viewers of the room.</body>
