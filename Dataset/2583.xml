	<body>What one could expect from a kind of remake of that work master rear window? Therefore what Disturbia is a modern tape, entretenidisima, without the slightest interest in showing something new, with a few young actors that meet their work more successfully (Shia LaBeouf is great). It may seem that the tape is too topical and empty, but it is that no one would expect more than she. Importantly is that it complies with their work, is not pretentious and a sunset in really good scene. Fast-paced action, a girl who eats the screen, a compelling bad (David Morse always goes well) and a no less topical or clear finish. We are of the first order, well filmed entertainment and fails to prove, at any time, false. If you are you looking for a remake worth what the Hitchcock movie was, you decepcionaréis you. If you are you looking for popcorn and entertain you for an hour and half, is what you will find. Perhaps too simple, without a penalty a moral, but knows at least entertain and this is what is appreciated more. Although I must admit that I liked more lives outside, the previous work of the director, without make it either, no wonder.In short, a movie to pass the time, which does not need you to think at any time and it is very, very entertaining. Recommended not to go with the idea that it is the new rear window. This is rather prying viewers.</body>
