	<body>Keenen Ivory Wayans rose to fame by the unexpected (and inexplicable IMHO) but overwhelming success of Scary Movie, who starred and directed in 2000. Since then had been behind and in front of the camera to bring us some esperpentos similar, full of uncouth, little imaginative, vulgar and regular humor. On this occasion it seems that at least the idea is something more original, because small but Hector tells the adventures of an expert thief of jewels out of prison after several years, which makes it with the intention of retiring from crime, though not without before a coup last and grandiose, consisting of appropriating a valuable site diamond in a jewelry shop. The thing is complicated and our protagonist is forced to hide the stone in the purse of a woman who was in the establishment together with her husband. To recover it not think another that take advantage of their peculiar physical (measured less than a meter) and impersonate a baby abandoned at the door of the residence of the marriage. Vanessa and Darryl welcome with enthusiasm and are supplied with enormous devotion to his work of parents. The multiple exploits and tricks of the tiny offender to recover their precious booty will be causing disparate situations. As already said before, this film is in the line of usual American humor, a humor eschatological, lacking in wit, Chavacano and rude, little or no contribution to the comedy. In a few months probably we will see on television, and in a short time over it, this ridiculous birriosa tape will be only a distant memory. Fortunately.</body>
