	<body>Titus Chinchan presents, this, I wanted to say Mrs Henderson presents a film that is faithful to the poster that advertises this. A point for not lying to viewers that we are already tired of covering up tremendous tru√±o on trailers and posters that have little to do with the final content.The film is about Mrs Henderson who in 1937 loses her husband. Given that it is rich, he decides to spend the evil drink do something new. One day, through an abandoned theatre and decides to buy it, to who it has not passed by the head buy a theatre? Total, that to bring this project decides to hire an old dog in the business. After many disputes among them, theatre begins its journey, but you need a little push, something that distinguishes them from others. What will happen? Her you can see and what you know.Well, I have to say that the film not called me no attention, but as advancing the footage I was dazzling. And is that the film is delicious, although not be what gender it is. Is of those that tell a story, with a little humor, a little bit of pity, a little bit of harangues to staff, a bit of inches. The actors do wonder, believing you every moment in this London to be bombed from one moment to another. The soundtrack is also suitable to the wonder and the screenplay hooks much, because you have not clear how it will end the story.In short, which I liked very much. In addition, gives an interesting overview of as we experienced the second world war in London, being able to seem frivolous, but it isn't. Highly recommended.</body>
