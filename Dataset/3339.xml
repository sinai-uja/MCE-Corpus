	<summary>If your job is boring you, if you are of your head until the very, and you do not believe that nothing there is worse than your life, take a look at the film, worth, and you will not regret.</summary>
	<body>Many times I say tape needs a 2 Â° viewing, to appreciate nuances, or find things that one, the first time he saw the film, he missed, this tape I can do another thing that recommend that second occasion, I remember the first time I saw her, was still a pipiolo (99 year) and although it worked, not caught all the nuances of the tapeI remember that I stayed with a couple of nuances, on the one hand the Jennifer Aniston relationship with the protagonist (that the film to be based on a daily comic strip was a "cantoso added" you can not see.) and on the other as you did the impossible life poor Milton (played by Stephen Root), who is the protagonist of the comic strip "Office Space" which gives name in V.O. film.Now, many years after its first screening, with a job each day has me more tired, and a life in common with a person, one from a completely different to the previous point, sees the tape many more malice, the character that, much more inept shows highest arrives in the company (something that happens far too often)(, where heads and leaders are always much more inept than the employees.), ugly work situation, which in this country today we also (calls charge X, that there will be one to make your work in half of what your desire.), or stupid moments but not power, encompass and compose a tape that is worth rediscovering, and that if the "romantic" part may be spent better than best, after all, and as I have already said, is an added cantoso to exploit a Jennifer Aniston newly discovered as Rachel on FRIENDS (paper repeats in 90% of the tapes stars).In short, If your job is boring you, if you are of your head until the very, and you do not believe that nothing there is worse than your life, take a look at the film, worth, and you will not regret.</body>
