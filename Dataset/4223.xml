	<body>New film nominated to the Oscars, this time in the category of best supporting actor chooses where to prize the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman, a Ribbon of coral, of those that make reflect, is that one who already knows what happened a few years later, cannot more than surprised and think that the efforts of Charlie Wilson to help Afghanistan and the mania of USA go "saviors of the universe" once again, and without that serve as a precedent, would return against, we all know what finally Afghanistan have dedicated themselves to do, and not I who unleash or open the box of Thunder.The cast is wonderful, with Tom Hanks in a permanent state of grace and achieved almost from the first moment that appears on screen, that you confabules with him and the history, then we have Julia Roberts, enormous, and his role that of the typical away where we have always seen; I understand that by Mrs. Roberts I feel something special and make what you do to my I'll love, while Dona Julia already begin to appear mayorcita on-screen or was only his role?On the other hand we have nominated Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and the recently emerging Amy Adams that we have seen in plenty of tapes as secondary and now thanks to this Disney's "enchanted" beginning to bring a career more or less dignified (and linear).Mike Nichols puts actors, the script, and an excellent plot and without too many Fireworks made up an excellent movie of those who, as I have already said, manage to excite and make think at the same time, although I would have ended it as they wanted to have done with a map or a visual reference to the terrible events we are now experiencing.We can see a kind of James Bond political, that same thing in Tom Hanks as Charlie Wilson fried a tie as iron an egg, histrionic, mast√≥dontico and knowing at that time say the right word or the perfect puya to leave amazed spectators.It is true that towards the middle of the film inevitably, a small drop of rhythm, where it seems that the action stops and nothing happens that would be worthwhile, fortunately the tape later launches vacuum towards its end, for all (more or less) known.In short: One of the great films of last year in USA, once again and without that serve as precedent arrives late to our bulletin board, and drawing the pull of the Oscars.</body>
