	<summary>One of these tapes claustrofobicas that glad to see where the bad feeling fills the screen from start to finish, and not resorting to the usual.</summary>
	<body>In the press pass, and as the end approached for "Mongus mortálitas" one of the critics who accompanied me, commented that both films ended equally; coincidentally the film that brings us, now is being projected on canal + so I consulted time and I started to see it.This film not only became worldwide famous director Alexander Aja (now in present day by "the hills have eyes") but also his female interpreter Cécile De France, who made the leap to the Mecca of cinema with this film.It is true that the end of both is almost tracing, but not only that, but that approach is also quite similar, forest, evil roll, bugs, and massacres in chain (never better said) hehe...The truth is that it is one of those tapes claustrofobicas that gives pleasure, contemplate, where the bad feeling fills the screen from beginning to end, and it's always (increases volume and cajquería in its purest form) are not used.Do in short, an interesting proposal? uropea of the genus.</body>
