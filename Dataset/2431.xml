	<body>One of those movies that you know from a jug of time ago and has never stopped to watch, it has been today, when a colleague has brought the (already descatalogada) DVD Edition and to insert the disc and start listening the first bars of "Dancing Queen" by ABBA, when I do not know very well why reason, I said let's see it!Toni Collette does here the work of his life, the film that you gave the fame (indeed, there to see the kilos this lady, has been removed appears to an Australian version of "Rosa de Spain"), in this "modern" version of Cinderella, passed through the sieve of the tragicomedy more deep and that at times even has touches of more scurfy film of our sesentera Spainhe accompanies Collete actress Rachel Griffith, which we have seen among others in "To 2 meters under the ground".And it is strange as a time to this part for women marriage is no longer one of its main priorities is no longer exists that mundane obsession dress white lives our protagonist, and even in some moments the film seems to be years light of the most recent events.Pity that you have some sweet and sour notes, and a rare final sense, go, a very broad and open end that one unfortunately has to take care.I can not stop me not to mention the soundtrack of ABBA, where the theme "Dancing Queen" is repeated many times, fails to tire, which is what has the mythical group nordico, that one can listen to the songs several times and not feel sick at any time.Ultimately, one of those movies that seems that lifelong living and that labour costs one sit down to watch.</body>
