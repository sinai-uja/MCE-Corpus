	<summary>Mediocrity along four "stories" which are intended to cover much more than it really can.</summary>
	<body>Giovanni Veronesi returns to the fray with a new installment of his Manuale DÂ´amore. On this occasion, and after the excellent results harvested for the first part, there is a most famous cast, in which repeated Carlo Verdone and they appear as dazzling beauties female Monica Bellucci and an Elsa Pataky still trying to look like an actress and that at times get even. This second Manuale uses the formula of having several (four in this case) different and independent stories. This is a method that I never liked because I think, one of the highest virtues of a film is having a continuity in the argument and that the connection between their different tramas and subtramas is, the less acceptable. Grosso modo, the first story is about the dazzling love that emerges from a rugged to your physiotherapist; the second is of a young italoespanyola which returns to Rome to present his son to his father; the third, a gay couple; and the fourth on a marriage that goes to a clinic of artificial insemination. Four "comic" compressed in a little less than two hours, although it is not give to much more. The interpretations are correct, especially that of a Monica Bellucci which our Elsa Pataky may have learned much. Appreciated, that Yes, the air of European, so different comedy on the tempos and the ways of the typical americanada. In any case, and having a long week of Carnival, wouldn't I which I mess in a movie theater to see this movie. But of course, that if the situation requires pasteleo, the occasion the paint it bald.</body>
