	<body>JEFF LIEBERMAN debuted in the mid-1970s already distant with the interesting SQUIRM. Typical serie b on mutant worms transmitting true talent in the plot and great sympathy in all your footage making it a small cult.However there stayed his work because his subsequent proposals did not be mediocre SLASHERS or Teleplays from desktop leaving his name into oblivion.Precisely these veterans with stagnant careers than practically already lost the opportunity to highlight the celluloid are occasionally before the nothing to lose are not afraid of the genre was taken lightly and offer full of freshness films on all four sides. In this lies the charm of this tiny production where the author sends walk all cinematographic standards leaving technicalities, forgetting to do something half decent quality.Simply leave take with sense of humor gone from revolutions to tell the Odyssey of a stupid kid lost helping a psychopath believing it to be part of the game. Before such cluster of little credible cirnscunstancias you let Guide to laugh leg loose with situations so surreal to cause a real Gale of good comedy probably carried out with the effrontery that in any case a prestigious director would dare to do.All that helped with actors in full possession of sobreactuaciones carried the limit where they emphasize the independent AMANDA PLUMMER "PULP FICTION, MIMIC 3" and the gorgeous KATHERYN WINNICK who appeared in some parts of the HELLRAISER series.In short a bad film but with the charm of the audacity that if you you take a joke you will spend a good time.</body>
