	<body>Provided that you ask me; What horror film enjoyed more in the cinema? I don't think, the word THE DESCENT rapidly comes to my mind. NEIL MARSHALL already had an interesting release in the very clean DOG SOLDIERS which mixed action, humor, GORE with good results.In this his second film nor a drop of comedy guiding us to a pure terror and without concessions to the Viewer, with a script that for once left side topics to focus on well built characters.A great point in its favour is the splendid work of its female cast led by SHAUNA MCDONALD in the series SPOOKS and NATALIE MENDOZA also comes from television where highlights culebron HOTEL BABYLON. The Interior of the caves are really creepy aided by cold photography, music is effective to destroy nerves in that bloody carousel where the deterioration of human relationships is more important than the monsters cannibals resembling the GOLLUM from the Lord of the rings.It initially seems a tale of adventure that recalls the DELIVERANCE female version becomes one of the most frightening experiences of cinema in recent years thanks to the talent of a director to follow in its next release DOOMSDAY.That same year premiere the damn cave almost same issue but much worse development.</body>
