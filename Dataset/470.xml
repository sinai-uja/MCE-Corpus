	<body>There are films that not filling cinemas or that not even pirating. They are films that have small cartoons of worldly people (or not so much), next to us. There are some that are tremendous pe√±azos, there is no who Digest. But there are also other very lively with a good script make us enjoy. And this is one of them.The film is a German Turkish guy who dreams of being the first head of a German kung-fu film. To start and get some publicity, made an announcement to his uncle for his kebab shop (the announcement must be seen, imperative) which is a great success and he promises a great future. But not everything in his life goes well, given that she leaves pregnant girlfriend German, which makes his father to antagonise.Good, good, good, good movie we saw the weekend. Camouflaged after a kind of sticky drama, have a very enjoyable script that touches many clubs, but unfinished deepen in none. We have social relations that exist in Germany between Turks, Germans and Greeks. The problems of the Turks with the paternity (with assume certain roles). The problems of young directors to get producers of parents and children who come to be worldwide with their subtleties and couples facing maturity suddenly. All this with much humor, sometimes subrealistas, but that take you quickly the smile. And we even have very emotive moments and some other parodies.In short, a very good and pretty, film that the chord and makes you feel better human being.</body>
