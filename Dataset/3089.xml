	<body>CONOR MCMAHON debuted in feature films with a couple of previous shorts starring the same actors who only have experience with this director. It is clear that they are a group of friends which means practically amateurs made a feature film I enjoyed some success in the DVD and festivals. Small appreciation they deserve only because of the difficulty involved this type of product.Another very different thing is practically non-existent quality in technical aspects. Makeup, photography, are of fireworks, does not help either poor interpretations of a wishful staff but really with zero quality.The strength lies in the originality of a little exploited script, mad cow Lions turning the population into ZOMBIES that attack plan. Al Gore resolves occasionally sorprendementé with dignity despite the poor media, the undead appear everywhere without giving Truce to survivors who maintain a fierce struggle giving a good pace at all times.A small production that keeps at least entertainment that makes it enjoyable, this Irish promises, then maybe with more resources in the future this trained to provide lightweight Divertimento solvents products among the most unabashed gore. A 6.</body>
