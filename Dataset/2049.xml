	<body>Spider-Man 3 is a tart of colors with beautiful special effects. I know, I'm not saying anything new. The other two movies were basically the same, only that it loses any developments. My main problem with this saga is that I do not swallow to the main character. Agree, Peter Parker is an anti-hero: a shy, ducks and pazguato genius using his suit high-tech to tie the girl from the movie. With that profile, all geek self-respecting, like me, we should worship the character, but is, in addition, Parker an integral asshole. There is no way of matching. There is no possible empathy. One looks forward to that bad loading once the man Spider to avoid having to see the ni침ato totontolculo in the next scene. This conception of the character is passable in the first installment, where something can be interpreted as an ir칩nico-cachonda eccentricity of the director. But in the two following games, the character not only not evolving, but is increasingly foolish in unbearable. And it seems that the director takes it seriously. The truth is that a consistent finish would have been Spider-man and his girlfriend die crushed by a giant Flyswatter, and so us we ahorr치bamos the fourth.Even so, this third installment is better that the second, and this is thanks to the bad guys. We presagi치bamos to finish watching the second a total fiasco by the reappearance of the new Goblin, but the truth is that James Franco gets to give charisma to Harry Osborn in this installment. Then, both Sandman com Venom, although little exploited, are achieved. Otherwise only is saved if you only look at the spectacular action scenes and special effects, which are at the height of the money spent.</body>
