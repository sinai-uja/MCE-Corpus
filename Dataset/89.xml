	<body>The Munich Olympics in 1972 became the history for the murder of 11 Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorist group "Black September". Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film begins by describing the fact, but only to give rise to what came later, the consequences. Here is where appears Avner (Eric Bana, who rose to fame with Hulk and Troy), Mossad agent, service secret Israeli, chosen to lead a group of five men which aims to kill the Palestinians responsible for the tragedy, those in different European countries. The way in which the film unfolds, at a superficial level, might convince some surprise that Munich is an action film. Clearly has all the ingredients that make gender honor: a heroic quasi main character, even with its weaknesses and miseries, a climate of tension that not lapses at any point in the film, missions of mission impossible style, and even moments and dialogs comic and pins, including a memorable style Spielberg staging, where Palestinians and Jews meet by chance in a house they rented to an informant and have no choice but to share a room, listening to music together, hiding their true identities and who would say, passing a good time. But not. The conflict Palestinian - Israeli is a sensitive and always trigger subject of disputes. Munich is no exception to this, and here is where lies the greatness of this film: in his reading, in his treatment on the subject, sobe everything if we consider that its director professes the Jewish religion, which hinders the impartiality, target too high to which any director could aspire. Spielberg almost achieved, with an entertaining story, impeccably directed, autocrìtico and reflective. Highly recommended.</body>
