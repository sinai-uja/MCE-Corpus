	<body>"The first shark, then Alien and now The Host." Very daring of the poster have seemed me to me. I I would have opted for "first Deep Blue See, later Karate to death in Torremolinos and now The Host". Basically the first were serious films, and this do not know if is laughable, if it is weeping (penalty is, if), if it is action or what noses is.The film is a crazy and very bad scientist makes a spill of something evil to a river. Total, that past age comes a tremendous bicharraco dedicated to eating people on the side of it. In these eats to the daughter of a fool dyed blond that runs a fast food stand next to his father. So I have to find silly, the father, a brother and a sister Briana. Well, and the army which puts them in quarantine but all go through the Arch of the mine Triunfo.Madre piece of truño, unbearable. Not understood if it is serious or not. For starters, the monster is fine, but is not topped (at a technical level). Then the human characters are tristísimos, bad acting and the pathetic role. The protagonist gives up even disgust. The argument is infumable and abhorrent, only can be save as movie monsters like Godzilla (cardboard) the first minutes. After the funeral (have no adjectives) this becomes an escalation of bobochorreces flowing into the lighting of the cauldron final. Insufrible.Resumiendo, abominable creation which is called movie only be broadcast in movie theaters. It empatiza more with the monster with the cast of actors that give penalty in a film that does not know if it is a parody of itself bad that is. Go to piss and no echar gota.</body>
