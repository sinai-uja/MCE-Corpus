	<body>See how we say this without us lapiden, but to me reminded me, saving the abyss, to perpetual chain. Ay, ay, ay, no me tireis stones, that truth that look like, and if not vedla and I say if you do not remember. By the way, that great film chain Perpetura, if not have seen, marchad video club urgently for her.The film is about a couple of kids, she a Duchess and he son of Carpenter, who want to live an impossible friendship in the late 19th Austria. Over the years, they return to find him become the best illusionist magician in the world and she in the future wife of the heir to the Empire. And between police investigations, unsolved crimes palatial intrigue incredible tricks and clandestine amorios runs the narration.Well, the movie I liked. My medium Zucchini said some fifteen times that it seemed slow, and some reason was, but to me I do not care. The performance of Mr Norton is fine, but is not the best. The tricks that are shocking and the atmosphere seems very sensible. The argument is not bad, with several interwoven stories, not of great depth, but let's film fun and entertain us, not burn neurons. And the end seemed wonderful, that needed me one thing, without violence, magical and beautiful.In short, entertaining movie of time, that is original on the approach and even more so in the resolution. We would appreciate that special effects are the fair and necessary, without fanfare.</body>
