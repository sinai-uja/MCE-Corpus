	<summary>If you are of those who enjoyed the first part, this will not disappoint</summary>
	<body>Not go much into details about the storyline of the film, that we explained in a previous post, only to say that there are still there where left off the characters in its first part, and which will be unveiled more secret, know several characters more and see how everything has an explanation and there was nothing random in its predecessor.We are not going to deceive anyone, the film follows the footsteps of its predecessor, frenetic and action almost without pause, fights between vampires and werewolves, much digital effect improved, and much, much blood everywhere, if you are of those who enjoyed the first part, this not you disappointment, if the first directly you didn't like or you leave indifferent certainly this also will do it.So what we have is entertainment pure and simple, is not to say that that is a bad film, on the contrary, within this type of genre stands out on the media as well as the to its predecessor, which shows us once again that make action movies, or fantasy film, not incompatible with some consistency when it comes to capture the images and tell a story.Note also the harshness of many of their digital effects, the fights have become more cruel and bloody, the desmembramientos and the ripped heads are several throughout the film, as well as the presence of blood and as they feed and use it as a way of transferring memories.The film leaves open the door to endless possibilities to make possible a third or more installments of the saga of vampires and werewolves.</body>
