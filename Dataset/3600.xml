	<body>After seeing "Critters" now, I keep rewinding time with tapes of Pixar, I suggested I go see all of here at the end of the year, so now it played the following occurred later, the second installment of the"toy" most famous of the cinema of animation of our times.Made just a year after "Critters" and intended for the DVD market, was John Lasseter who pushed the tape everything he could to "move" directly onto cinema screens, it getting also the prize for the best animation film.The villain of the tape, which provides voice actor Wayne Knight, this fact almost almost to his image and likeness.Again the voices we have Tim Allen and to Tom Hanks in V.O. addition, his voice not inferior in any way, as well as its argument (riddled with references to cinemat√≥graficas are going since 2001 an Odyssey of the space, Star Wars, Jurassic Park or some other Western).On the soundtrack we have Randy Newman, one of the usual Pixar with the current Michael Giacchino (which has made the "The Incredibles" or the "Ratatouille" as well as various Pixar shorts).In short, an excellent continuation of a myth of the animation current as they are the first characters created by Pixar, to which a server has special affection, and with which they could get me the thorn photographing me both.</body>
