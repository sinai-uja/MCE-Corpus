	<summary>Totally recommended for those who are fans of the saga or very enthusiastic of the action movies, certainly if you are a gourmet not go to see her.</summary>
	<body>Undoubtedly one of the most anticipated films of this year to close a "round" saga that has kept us in check since 2002 thanks to a perfect combination, palomiteros Tony Gilroy scripts and interpretation by HardBoy Matt Damon.Paul Greengrass repeats address as it already did in "The Bourne Supremacy" but for my taste this time makes it better than the previous. I do not know if it is because we finally know all the details, but this film is that I like most about the saga. Is that by now it has ended but I am sure that when run out ideas in hollywood again doing another type "Bourne Returns" or something.The man with more head of the star system. Matt Damon, is very well in his role. To me this guy even Capito I love. Nostalgia that'm me no longer the boy who was, and is that our boy has already 37 añazos (officers, insurance that is older, all are removed years already know.) and you are noticing the wrinkles. The next thing we'll see Matty is "Margaret" directed by Kenneth Lonergan (Gangs of New York) and co-starring the ugly Anna Paquin. Another interesting thing is the new "Youth Without Youth" Coppola movie whose premiere will also be during 2007. The next thing see you in 2009.The Bourne Ultimatum, is a totally recommended film for those who are fans of the saga or very enthusiastic of action films, since then if you're a gourmet not go to see her. In my case, I expected less than what I found. When it seemed that this story was no longer able to entertain us, not only get but that beat expectations. The pace is perfect, has its necessary moments of pause and a fast-paced action that never disappoints or is pre-match.Warning: Cinema popcorn, but of forced step.</body>
