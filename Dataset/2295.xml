	<summary>A missed opportunity to revitalize a dying genre; inexplicably, but dying.</summary>
	<body>The abandonment to which has been subjected for decades the film noir by the industry, is something that I have never right to understand. The films of this genre, when done well, dazzle to the public, and become reference and cult films for many.Lonely hearts tells the story of two killers who acted in the middle of the last century and dedicated to seducing ladies and solitary wealthy then kill them and steal them. But what could be a good story has been little more than anything because of lack of expertise of its director Todd Robinson, has not managed to create the atmosphere needed to catch the Viewer, or has performers that make up the cast to represent roles or to convey the slightest sense to a viewer that little more than endure the time can make credible.The fact that nothing more start appears telef√≠lmico "based on actual events" banner already portends the worst, because rarely worth what comes after him; and of course, this is not the exception that proves the rule. A displaced John Travolta, shielded by a untapped Gandolfini and one misguided Salma Hayek, nor contribute to improve the final product, which strikes as vacuous and lacking in the necessary push to revitalize a genre once hailed. The fact that the own Distributor has postponed its release on several occasions is clear sample of the lack of interest in promoting a gender phagocytosed and marginalized by an industry geared to exploit the only commercial aspect of cinema, without taking into account and without remembering that all the successes are usually preceded by a good job.</body>
