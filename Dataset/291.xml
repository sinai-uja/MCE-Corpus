	<body>Well, I wanted to see the return of Michael Douglas (accompanied by a stunning cast) to the big screen, the penalty is that this kind of political thrillers we see them from time to time on screen, and to the predictability of the argument and development, one has to take some imagination and good roll to be able to digest.And is that his hour and 40 min. Skinny footage please do the film, with a rather abrupt ending, which attempts to solve the plots that have been opening doors during the movie, true is that Clark Johnson, who as Shyamalan always appears in his films, composes one of those movies that are profitable for the study, both actors (just for the box office)(, on DVD and the projection television, recovers more than invested) and although the film, one of many, has its touches of genius, know us a story that already have told us many times.Incidentally, Douglas arrives to remind Eastwood in "In the line of fire" and is there certain ages that is little credible the role of bodyguard, much better Kiefer Sutherland (repeating a role similar to the "24" series), as well as the debut of Eva Longoria (the bride of the basis of the Spurs, Tony Parker), on screen, making a hole to the most famous Hispanic of the Mecca of cinema; separate mention Kim Bassinger who is no longer a girl, but still shows that feelling of yesteryear.Anyway, the movie is interesting, the penalty is to know "already sucked caramel".</body>
