	<summary>The film is not a simple reflection on death but the presentation, second by second, of the same death.</summary>
	<body>Crudísimo film that is installed in the last days of Nicholas Ray - being consumed by a cancer that affects a shred a lucidity that, in this context, it is atrocious - lightning over water (or Nick's movie) is a sort of documentary on the fictionalization of the creation process of a film between Wenders and Ray, that is - that ends up being - this same film. In this sense, the film is an inquiry into movies, the possibilities of film, the limits of fiction.However, the film is not a simple reflection on death but the presentation, second by second, of the same death. To very little of his death, with a body that does not already give to coarse, Ray installs the entire team of filming in his house and shows us the desperate reality of impending death. The filmmaker is obviously very sick, but his lucidity is intact. She lectures, writes, it is doing a film. And he knows that he has to die. In this despair, which does however not fall never into low blows or attacks of hysteria, the film dives us in that infinite sadness.And in addition to classic and unbelievably beautiful levels of Wenders in the city, the film also has bright reflections, both on film and on death, by both managers.Lightning over water is, if not aesthetically outstanding - as it might be expected of a Wenders to the head, but that in this case would have been almost insulting - Yes very intelligent and deeply emotional. Crude, but a gem.</body>
