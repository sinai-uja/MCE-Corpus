	<summary>New contempt for American industry to the intelligence of the viewers, who does not offer more than trash canned in metres from celluloid whose best destination would be the serving of food to a herd of marranos.</summary>
	<body>With a slightly more original plot than usual in this type of film waste, Cry Wolf is another by-product of the decadent and abominable part of the American motion picture industry geared to produce a crappy after another for adolescents whose intelligence despises and offends constantly, offering trash in way to do films? they lack the most basic logics and are limited to be a succession of shouts, viscera, deaths and absurd persecution in which a type who walks step light reaches people running desperately. As I have said before, your script has some touches of originality, although insufficient to convert this aberration in a film. Full of topics throughout all your footage (the phone with voice distorsionador, the hooded, suspicions among the hysterical screams, etc.), is shameful above reach our country two years too late, and to do so to undermine the possibility of screening films of truth which will be condemned to ostracism and rotting in warehouses. Meanwhile, this pigswill, however difficult it is to believe, will probably have a decent collection thanks to the horde of teenagers that go to the rooms to hang out, and fortunately will pay you little attention.Of the actors, very little to say, except that is striking the pathetic presence of decadent Jon Bon Jovi, endeavoured to appear on the big screen though it to ridicule. Cry Wolf is not a thriller, nor is it a film of terror, or suspense, or nothing at all. It is just an hour and a half run away.</body>
