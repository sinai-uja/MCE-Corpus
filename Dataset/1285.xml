	<body>It is not to be passionate about the Darren Aronofsky film, I saw "Requiem for a dream" and stop you have, especially when at the end of this a sense of "bad roll" I invaded during at least 3 or 4 days, so not left me wanting to go diving in the Filmography of the director, until in a press pass someone I spoke of "The Fountain" (the source of life)praising the virtues of Aronofsky as the master performances of Hugh Jackman and the wife of the director, Rachel Weisz.Explicar the film with words it is complicated, it is a story that takes place in 3 different times (past, present and future) and where the search for eternal life is the crux of the matter, the past and the present are easy to understandthe future, I personally was a cousin face tremendous and even though I gave round little, to say nothing, I have come to understand; It is true that perhaps, and based only on view images, is one of the most poetic films which I have faced as a viewer; Perhaps much more than "perfume", which distilled poetry in almost all of their footage.On the other hand, and noise level, Aronofsky repeats Kronos Quartet, so that ritmillo I already met in "Requiem for a dream" is becoming, soundly marks from the House of the director, accompanying not only sincere and logical what happens on screen, but that musically (if closed eyes and only escucharamos music), leads to a different universe.Both interpretive level Jackman as Weisz are excellent, will have to take up the cudgels in favour of Hugh, who always saw on-screen as Wolverine and which could not separate the interpretation in X-Men the rest of roles that saw him interpret; Weisz is case aside, I've always liked and found me a great (on par with precious) actress.Finally, it is not easy to understand, but it is an amazing film which is worth discovering.</body>
