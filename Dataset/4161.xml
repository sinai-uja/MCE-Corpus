	<body>United States is a strange country where anyone can buy a gun in a supermarket, where the world is divided into "good and bad", a place where if you don't have money have no right to a doctor, a place where torture prisoners who have not even had a trial and where is killed by a lethal injection to those who had also previously killed, and this country aims to "democratize" other country called Iraq based on bombs, death and destruction.This delusional situation was born this film, based on a real event, directed and written by Paul Haggis, director of the great Crash, for which he won an oscar and screenwriter of Million Dollar Baby. Hank (Tommy Lee Jones), war veteran American, begins to investigate the disappearance of his son Mike (Jonathan Tucker), soldier in Iraq that returning to his country, is absent without permission during several days of its base. With the help of the detective Sanders (Charlize Theron) truth about the guy will be coming to light little by little.This is a fresh look at the conflict, which focuses on behaviors and disorders suffered by soldiers returning from Iraq, and is that the victims of war are not only those who die in them, the emotional damage it may suffer a person subjected to an extreme situation like that can be unpredictable and brutal, as we could with those famous images of soldiers divierti√©ndose while they torturing prisoners who turned over the world.The Paul Haggis film talks about all this focus in the case of a soldier missing days after appearing killed brutally, the investigation of his death, take his father and a police to go little by little knowing the facts that ended with his life.The actors are all correct, including Susan Sarandon in her small role; the protagonist, Tommy Lee Jones, nominated for an oscar for this role, performs a restrained and realistic interpretation, it is not a role that they do look for an actor and Charlize Theron plays a police ninguneada by his classmates for being too nice, which has to prove its worth, something that will get with this case.In the Valley of Elah is a very well told film that is giving us, intelligently, small doses of information prior to getting to know all the truth that it unveiled at the end, all this in a tone quiet and thoughtful to have truly terrible things inviting us to think in a reality that scares, something that in Europe we are more accustomed in the USAwhere the truth about this conflict is hidden under a halo of patriotism and absolute selfishness.The film has many quality, and although cinematically stresses not excessively, the topic is is so important and so necessary is to mention him, which becomes an essential film.</body>
