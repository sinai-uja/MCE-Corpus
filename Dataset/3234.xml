	<summary>Pleasant and entertaining, they would be two stars and media but until that the head do not pull the roll can approve movies. It is a 5'5, try to put it with "stars".</summary>
	<body>In little more than four weeks and practically a single location these two debutantes shot this nice film, small and endearing moments except some slippage in the performances, perhaps Alejo Sauras I finished convincing in a fairly restrained cast that seems to be (for good) in a cure anti stress.Four mathematicians gathered in a room by a mysterious host discover that room which can not leave is declining, which is a commendable effort in maintaining the suspense and a great joke end. Highlight the soundtrack of the film runs in charge of Los Planetas, a success and a declaration of intent on the kind of Viewer you are looking for the film. As pleasant viewing her as likely to forget her, not bad when a film is humble and honest without looking for false claims. Very decent work which I hope will serve to ensure that these two "magicians" seek new illusions that surprise us in the future.</body>
