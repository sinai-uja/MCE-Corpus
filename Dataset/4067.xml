	<summary>One of these films to enjoy on the big screen.</summary>
	<body>For a long time that a film not let me completely perplexed in the cinema, such as dishes and wide open mouth, eyes and repeating over and over again a thousand exclamations.Spielberg manages to get the bad feeling in the body, spend the entire film bereaved by what appears on the screen and put us in the role of Ray and his daughter (priceless performance of Dakota Fanning), perhaps I see two weak points in the film, one the speed with which it ends, it is true that the entire film is a pure climax and that little is ultimately to contribute, but the resolution is too simplistic, not liked the appearance of the son "as he does not want the thing".Finally, another of those movies to be enjoy on the big screen.</body>
