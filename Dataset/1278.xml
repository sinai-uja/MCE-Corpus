	<body>Déjà vu (2006) is a film that can ignore. The story is nonsense with time travel impossible. The film begins with a ferry crowded marine celebrating with their families the Mardi Gras. Suddenly, boom, exploited and killed almost all (another excellent idea for terrorists). Denzel Washington plays the agent assigned to the case. In the process of research, he discovers the corpse of a burnt woman, however, it does not belong to the explosion. More or less that falls for the corpse, strange as it sounds, all of course can be attributed to the title of the film. Finally, also by chance he discovers that another team of agents, led by a cachetonízimooo Val Kilmer has a time machine, which can record video the past, exactly 4 days and 6 hours ago, not more, not less, and only that. And thus begins to get more and more pastrula history, because Denzel of course wants to stop the terrorist (it is only one, not an organization, simply a crazy "Patriot" played by James Caviezel) and save the girl, changing the destination and the present. Yes are still interested in seeing the film to do so, but not stating that in EBC were not advised of a loose story where you look.Strange that good actors have accepted to participate in the project. Denzel, why do you did?Ah, to all this, the used scenario is New Orleans, as a sort of tribute to the victims of Hurricane Katrina, even many of the survivors of the disaster, participated in the production as extras.The director graciosito, Tony Scott, was sent to a pole that read: "Malcolm X, Jesus Christ, and Jim Morrison: Deja Vu." "How Can We Fail?"My opinión: Still, you failed:(</body>
