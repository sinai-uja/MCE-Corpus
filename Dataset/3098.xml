	<body>What is the Canada CRONEMBERG disregards his obsessions of the past that both surprised in its principles. Female genital mutilation, the new flesh, genetic experiments in unforgettable terrors orchestrated by the mastery of one of the most psychedelic minds of the current panorama. VIDEODROME or the fly are among my favorite films. I do not remember where law that this author is a poet of the dark. Totally agree with that statement, because changing the horror by a slightly more edible film for the large audience, his films remain quite sinister. Where crazed characters passing through universes traced under the mantle of his brilliant madness.An accomplice of luxury found in the brilliant actor "VIGGO MORTENSEN" who was already colossal in the previous collaboration of both "A history of violence". Nothing new under the Sun in is Eastern promises, a very hard story of a suffocating darkness where an outstanding cast does the rest.In addition to MORTENSEN we meet NAOMI WATTS "THE RING", VINCENT CASSEL "DOBERMAN", ARMIN MUELLER-STAHL "The music box". Again the poet of the dark is handled way exemplary about characters in the wire before really atrocious acts that put goose bumps. The fight in the sauna is already a really memorable time in the Filmography of genius.</body>
