	<body>I have not ever seen a film so inevitably doomed to fill the shelves of the video shops. Its eye-catching posters could cause customer recale boxed DVD and rent it. It could bring together a gang of teenagers, well crammed of potatoes in bag, soft drinks and dried fruits, that divertir√≠an a big way with this ghost story from farm to return to the world of the living to cry revenge. It often happens. The most striking is that Sam Raimi, director brave and, apparently, already well released horror films producer, has seen something good in this infumable pastiche, that not scary and lost boldly and lack of modesty in hundreds, I said well, movies with similar ingredients. We appoint: House Bewitched, family problems and paid basements of scares. As he is about to start your shopping journey on DVD, take note the demanding reader and does not fall into the trap that I've committed. Devoted his splendid time to re-read the classics or start that novel that is without manipulating still or leave pollute the pure and inmarcesible beauty of M, the vampire of Dusseldorf. That as comes me this title? By necessity, out of sheer necessity. In any case, the range of possibilities is enormous. Life is a delight when one finds these small pleasures that engolosinan US leisure and produce these tickling in the pit of the stomach. The closest thing to love.</body>
