	<body>The game of the castle that the nazis that killing the ibas person I liked (I think it was exhaust from wolftein). Then came from Doom and hooked me a lot, but with loudspeakers began to acojonar. It was later released one was Duke Nuke (more or less) and already I didn't, given that I was more scared than seven old boards. Finally (for me) the second part of Doom came out and I spent directly already play, these sounds through the speakers I ended up twitching in making me be now you know. Neither the genetic experiments.The film is very direct. It's about a group of elite soldiers who enter on Mars (with two balls) given that some excavations we have there been problems. So the 10 minutes we are already task, without even introducing us to the protagonists. So they caught the pistolones and engaged to kill everything they can. Unlike in the game, but more slowly.Let's see, things that I liked. The protagonists are professional soldiers, we do not have any scientist who give him a gun and it seems Rambo. A point in its favour. The time in which the protagonist takes the vision of the game is the effect of the game between horny and stupid, but very accomplished. Another point in their favor. And the rest is hell. My girl says that it can be seen, meaning that the level of disgust is low and that little scary. I say that you from me a piece of Alien, a piece of Resident Evil and a shredded brain and we have a reef with this series. I am not going to say that you expected me more, given that lying vilely, why I am not going to be cruel with the film.In short, be seen but without many pretensions.</body>
