	<body>Maybe have been better to wait until now to talk about this movie when already all the vibes of "ohhh a movie about gay Cowboys" longer step, at least so it is possible to speak of it as what it is, i.e. a movie.As everyone knows the movie narrates the love story between Ennis and Jack, two Cowboys begin a secret romance and extends for many years; logically this romance is secret and both their lives conventional with wives and children only meet some times in the year, eventually costs do what more you want to secretly reach them.I believe that this movie has been put to the test the intelligence of many people, on the one hand those who see the movie only as a gay movie and therefore feels a kind of rejection/morbid fascination with the movie and on the other hand those who believe that the best of the movie is the fact that the case of a gay couple and therefore see as a sort of symbol of the cause, I believe that both positions are erroneous.In this sense only Brokeback Mountain features a theme which has been narrated thousands of times as it is impossible to love and the impossibility of being with the person that you love, from Romeo and Juliet through interracial love stories, the theme is the same only that currently there are homosexuals who by social pressure has dificulrtades to be together as before the people of different race or religion.Â¿Es were a perfect movie? For nothing, it is true that it has some problems of rhythm and that compared to other films which portrayed honors last year as a Crash, this clearly less structured, obviously Crash is better narrativamente, Brokeback Mountain is however the best film of the past year, precisely because of their imprefecciones and the strength of its history.Even though the script has some flaws, the film very well directed, photography and music are extraordinary and the actions of truth are very good, especially of the couple protagonistano only by the obviousness of portraying a gay couple, but because they are able to reflect differently the same anguish and sadness, while much of the elogos took them Heath Ledger I believe the weight of the movie is what It carries Gyllenhaal is far one of the best young actors today, especially the scenes where his character faces the Ledger by the fact of not having been able to make a living together.This is a sad and fragile movie and think that you can only appeal to gays is stupid, heterosexual or homosexual anyone who ever has been able to be with the person she loves is able to understand this movie and feel identified with it. In short, highly recommended almost pin, five stars and this DVD</body>
