	<summary>Recommended for all those who have been in Paris at least once in life.</summary>
	<body>Set in Paris, both in that part of the city that we know all the tourists, as in that part they only know the Parisian citizens, this film composed of small scraps of stories, featuring thousand familiar faces (Steve Buscemi, Leonor Watling, Natalie Portman, Javier CÃ¡mara, Sophie Marceau, Willem Dafoe, Nick Nolte, Bob Hoskins, Elijah Wood.) and directed by a thousand names of cinemacomposed in their own way, each a story that blurs and draw at the same time the city of love.Some brief, very brief, others more long, some comic, others tragic, one of terror, other passion, but always with the thread of the eternal city's Fund, leaves a good taste in mouth and the feeling that in just a few minutes. You can say and tell big things.Recommended for all those who have been in Paris at least once in life.</body>
