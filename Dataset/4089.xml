	<body>If I say DANIEL MYRICK? Sound them of something? Probably not much or practically nothing, if I say that it was one of the authors of the blair witch project? Surely sound them far more. Something really inexplicable both disappeared after performing with Eduardo Sánchez, which without doubt is the most profitable film in the history of the cinema. Lately it seems reborn from its ashes by Eduardo Sánchez reappeared with the magnificent ALTERED. Meanwhile Daniel was crashing with the entire team in BELIEVERS an ill-fated production on sects released directly to DVD.A credit needed in this very correct SOLSTICE arrives with a new release for the home market. Relying on interpreters to begin his career with the gorgeous ELIZABETH HARNOIS, known in the United States for his role in the series ONE TREE HILL, providing the veterania the sheriff psychopath of the massacre of Texas 2003 LEE ERMEY.All great in characters who have a good development in a film that moves more between the drama and intrigue with touches of apparitions, this very well run on the strength of the script with the launch of very correct scene, technically despite the low budget are really notable in all its aspects.A good film of psychological horror, burdened by a somewhat hasty end even if leave you a good taste.</body>
