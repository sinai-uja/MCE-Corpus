	<body>Boredom. That is the word that defines the first tropezón serious master Clint (blood was also a bit bland, but is this above pretentious) when I watch flags of our fathers. Where do I start?The film has a structure of loop and the same three scenes repeated incessantly during the two (long) hours of footage.First we have a flashback of the battlefield, then a scene of Office and then a scene of sports field. And so the film is passed.Then there are the actors that have charisma or excited, especially Adam Beach, regrettable, that achieves that Ryan Phillippe seem actor. The side go out there, and we find Paul Walter or Barry Pepper, (the latter seems just out of saving private Ryan) or with Billy Elliot reprising his role of King Kong. The music is as repetitive as the structure of the narrative, i.e. also bored and comes to tire. The history is quite bland and trilladísima. Positive it? The war sequences, superbly treated and shot with overwhelming classicism. I will see the letters from Iwo Jima, because it can not be more boring than this.</body>
