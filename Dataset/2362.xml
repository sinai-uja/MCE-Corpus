	<summary>A movie in which the lack of rhythm and feeling bedevil a good script and a unique historic atmosphere.</summary>
	<body>They tend to fascinate a priori the films which are set in other times and places with environments and very different to the usual European and American environments. The charm and the capacity of seduction of Asian countries, with their decadent appearance from the beginning of the last century, is undeniable, but always attempt this does not prevent me to comment on the film with equanimity and justice due to any critical judgement.The Russian Countess is a production that brings together the features previously mentioned, which is compounded by the presence of a Ralph Fiennes always correct, and to a lesser extent that of Natasha Richardson, being merely anecdotal and irrelevant of Vanessa Redgrave.La film chronicles the experiences of an American diplomat blinded by an accident, and that manages to fulfill his dream of opening a nightclubat the head of which he placed to a former Russian Countess exercising prostitution after leaving so idealized exiled by the Bolshevik revolution that Russia have some and that so many lives cut short.The good atmosphere and a dash more or less interesting, not enough however to achieve a rounded product, because the lack of pace and ability to connect with the spectator are barriers clearly attributable to a James Ivory that usually suffer from a lack of feeling. Although it is difficult, there is a compromise between the coldness and the sentimentality, and there is where the capacity of the director should weigh more to achieve it.From the technical point of view, it is more than correct. Without fanfare, but correct.In any case, is a film entertaining, well finished, that this lack of feeling and rhythm depriving themselves of a better rating, but it used to have more or less fun.</body>
