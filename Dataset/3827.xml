	<body>In 2001 after an incredible investigation ended to the biggest mistake in the FBI intelligence services stopping Robert Hanssen, apparently a careful Christian, a great worker and a spotless agent which ensured the security of the networks of the Buro. Eric O'Neill will be in charge of spying on its head. This will depend on that you an end to the filtration and possibly their future in the FBI as agent secret take-off. They are the basic ingredients to make a good spy movie. One of these has no unnecessary gunfire and international travel, i.e. something that can be the viewer attractive and appealing, but is based on real events which gives one some tranquility within the narrative.Billy Ray, the director has already had contact with real life stories with his debut in 2003 with "The price of truth" (Ribbon that I enjoyed about way) and recalled in this way. Get the camera on your site and not abuse of unnecessary resources for the approach of its history. It is also the screenwriter of the film for what can blame you the only weak point of this, the little care to the relationship between the character of Ryan Philippe with his wife who could have completed a round plot.Anyway is a very dignified and recommended film that manages to keep intact the thriller with twists care quite notable performances.Conclusions after seeing the Film: Laura Linney is omnipresent, he has managed to sneak into almost all films 2007 dignity and almost always correctly.The bigoted weakling and attractive Ryan Philippe of Studio 54 has won in interpretation but also in kilos (such as thirty if I get to calculate) Chris Cooper is superb and gives credibility to his character in one of the best performances of the year 2007.</body>
