	<summary>A job worthy of commendation for the skills in the development of a script of height which denies categorically to those who argue that science fiction and terror are minor genres.</summary>
	<body>Science fiction returns to the Spanish screens in the hands of the Canarian Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, which goes back to a genre that already cultivated with intact, his only foray so far in the world of cinema, with the exception of a couple of short films. 28 weeks later is the second part of 28 days later, that for those who do not know or remember, recounted the disaster caused by the release of a virus that makes the British population assassins and forced to shut down the country. This then starts six months after the first, a time in which after deletion of the virus, the country began to be repopulated.As usual in this kind of films, under the mask of the action and the pseudoterror, lies a message that parallels and analogies, aims to alert viewers and the population in general of possible situations that could not change the direction of events. In recent times, the laboratories have replaced nuclear weapons as a symbol of the decay and the inevitable destruction of a devalued world and poised his steps firmly into the abyss.From the technical point of view, is noticeable the magnificent use of sound, music and silences of interchangeable tools how to generate tension. In addition, the script is quite enough better that that of its predecessor, so get well-crafted, transmitted sensations of angst and chaos he wants; all this through a well defined characters. The cast is acceptable, although perhaps somewhat weakens the overrated Robert Carlyle. In general, a good movie, where aware of the gender and the type of film that is going to witness.</body>
