	<body>Where this good Spanish cinema? Here, escondidito, unnoticed, without Titanic promotions or Fireworks, but it exists. "Descongéla_" joins with the costumbrista trend more Almodóvar, but also with the quality as our director manchego tapes it is customary.This is a smart and fresh, tape with a few players in State of grace, a careful ambiance and a production full of loving care and professionalism. Agustín Almodóvar sponsor a unique film per year, this, without a doubt, she deserved. Black, paranoid, humor with intelligent dialogues and a wonderful cast. A Candela Peña talented and totally wonderful. Grandson, pulling very well, at best, as always. Loles León, reinterpreting its role, that's what makes it of fear and a simply mythical Jaenada. The rest, to the height, which is the height of the same sky, and the movie that, although he could have even a little more pitched in the comic part, works in his dramatic gear as a true clock, finally to be a good comedy Rodeo, kooky and black humor.</body>
