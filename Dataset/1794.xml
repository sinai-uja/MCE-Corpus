	<body>Today, me I have planted in front of the last tape of the off-road Marc Foster, a director, which, on the other hand, I start to remember James Mangold, that you can be a romantic comedy, a terrifying thriller, or biographical tape and all it will draw huge film benefits, Foster, who we met with "Monster Ball" (where Halle Berry caught an Oscar)then we accompany you in the pseudo-biopic of John Barry (the author of "Peter Pan") at "Finding Neverland", plasma us here debtor Charlie Kauffman film tape and it is that, dear friends, the parallels between this film and "Adaptation – the Orchid thief" is more than casual, and while in the excellent film that starred Nicolas Cage he deprived almost comedy, here, have a drama sweetened with some that another fun brushstroke.I was used to seeing Will Ferrell in other registers, perhaps, here, is approaching more character who already played in this misunderstood masterpiece that is "Melinda &amp; Melinda", outside the film jester which often give life in their films; This story, developed in 2 threads, 2 perfectly differentiated areas, which end up merging into one, is perhaps one of the surprises, cinematically speaking, with which I have found in what he took of course 2007.Emma Thompson, a film star that I wonder, and is that I have a predilection for the British actress, as happens with Kenneth Branagh that I cannot help but feel admiration and a few small drops of healthy envy, to see a job and an interpretation so masterful even the eclectic Queen Latifaf appears excellent, cone, which I liked to Dustin Hoffman, who from "Rain Man" couldn't you so focused on a paper, and playing well so lavishly that Professor of literature, who tries to help the protagonist, he could not forget me by Linda Hunt, in a brief interpretationan actress that I have a singular affection, not because of his short stature, but because many of the films where spoke are close to the Olympus of my favourite film.Comedy mixed with tragedy, where us is overwhelmed, always in small doses, with the course of events, with the plot, which seems always predictable and that however it is not so much, and with a plot twist that leaves us a sweet taste and a smile from ear to ear to appear the final opening credits.In short, unpredictable exercise of film that I liked more than I could imagine.</body>
