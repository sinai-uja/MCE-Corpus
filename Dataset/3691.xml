	<summary>A good idea, excellent initial minutes and a lousy and mediocre development.</summary>
	<body>I admit, with hand on heart, that when I saw the first few minutes, I found not only disturbing, but also quite well done, also add that before had read me the story of S.King which is "slightly" based (there are so many changes, that one not sure if it is really so, or free, so free adaptation that only match the names and little else.).After the first minutes, that I agree with the vast majority of critics I've read, are the best in the tape, this falls into the clichés, even attempted, lengthening in excess that story we talked about earlier, put as many references as possible, from "The shining" and"Dante hell" all together, mixed but not removed, and where the only thing saved from burning is John Cusack, which knows how to act at all times making us see scared shitless that is on the screen.The rest, including Samuel L.Jackson (mere secondary, excecepción, but secondary.) are Jessi, pulling out mediocre, to tell the truth; Note also the compendium of special effects, could not be otherwise in this type of tape, the Lebanese Gabriel Yared's terrifying soundtrack, and the idea, which is good, but does not give to a tape 90 min. Do not ever think of why King put this story in the mini-series "Nightmares and hallucinations"? As a curiosity, add that in USA DVD of the film, it appears an alternate ending that nothing has to do with the one shown on screen (and which is not it better, let's say).In short: A good idea, excellent initial minutes and a lousy and mediocre development.</body>
