	<body>Directed by Lee Sang-il and starring Yasuko Matsuyuki, Etsushi Toyokawa, Yu Aoi, Shizuyo Yamazaki, Ittoku Kishibe, and Sumiko Fuji, Hula Girls has won four awards from the Academy of the Japan film, in addition to having been elected by his country as a candidate to the Oscar's this year.Based on real events, Hula girls tells the story of the daughters of miners of coal of a small and remote village that will face to the tradition and its grey destination as for through the Hawaiian hula dance, with the help of his teacher of dance, women become involuntary heroines of his people in crisis and throughout the country.I have to say that Hula Girls has seemed, in general terms, a ravishing film: under a premise of self-improvement and hope, the Japanese film could be considered, as well have already said in many other places, a kind of Japanese Billy Elliot, while particular mode both conduct and interpret Japan make it a completely different film.With her both share the theme of the dance as a means of escape from a nothing grim reality as the background of a society in crisis, or what is the same, the longing of a group of characters make their dreams a reality and prove his worth. Although posts to compare, even the series Fame could accomplish that same premise, so.What perhaps distinguishes to Hula girls of other similar productions is its treatment, more positive than dramatic, in which not avoids the drama or tragedy, but where we find that the strength of their characters makes them really able to overcome the blows of fate determination, desire for improvement, and friendship. In this way, the look more appealing Hula girls are their characters, portrayed magnificently from a good start, outlining the different archetypes but at the same time into a credible and unique beings.On the other hand, applies to Hula girls sinneth in some moments of being even slightly sweetened, possess certain effect blows something previsibes, but both the attachment that the viewer feels for their protagonists to five minutes of projection as his characteristic sense of humor do we overlook their flirtations with a kind of more commercial cinemain a really emotional and brimming with sensations film positive.</body>
