	<body>After reading reviews that described alien vs. Predator as disastrous, never thought that he would go to see the second part, or even that it would do so. Unfortunately, this sequel exists, done not too hopeful for the science fiction film. It is probably a little better than its predecessor, but Alien vs Predator 2 is too weak to be considered a film. If anything, it could be issued in telivisión, and thus would play perfectly as a film of serie B, but I don't know who had the idea to distribute it as one blockbuster either. It is bad to say enough is enough and contains dialogues that seem taken from the telefilm cheaper history topics abound as they had never done in another film (look at the storyline of the young lovers, quite pathetic). The script is practically non-existent, seems to be written as according to the March, and the villain (human) character it has much less expressive than the Alien or the Predator (excessively cumbersome the fight between these two end). Yes, is a very tacky tacky film (look also at the closing credits), with unforgettable phrases such as "the Government is never wrong" or an end to spare more than "bad" history adolescent teen. And it would have been much better if he had quit as thought I that would end with the helicopter with the last surviving crashing. In short, a huge hodgepodge, made no hint of grace and truly pathetic interpretations. That Yes, contains a couple of scenes quite frightening and not too bad. Better avoid you it, they will come out winning.</body>
