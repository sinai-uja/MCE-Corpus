	<body>For some reason, the supposedly independent or independent - films - American typically arise in their stories around a group of atypical characters that interact in some way (usually, forming part of the same family). "Little Miss Sunshine" is no exception. Provided that you do not hate that - absurd dialogues, surreal situations - style, you can find very good works, as this road movie, which invents nothing new, but what counts, it has well. "Little Miss Sunshine" has a family trip to California for the small Olivia, 7 years, may participate in one of those grotesque children's beauty pageants. IE: a girl with glasses and teeth of rabbit (that Yes, very funny), a father obsessed with success, a grandfather who have missed the residence by his fondness for drugs, a suicidal uncle, a brother who did vow of silence and a mother more or less normal in a damaged van in which there is to climb up because does not work the first. This narrated with agility, so that the result is a film fun, entertaining, beautiful and occasionally humbling, provided that the Viewer is able to tolerate the lack of verisimilitud of some moments. They could not miss the dramatic touches, but that Yes, in its fair measure. Dialogue tío-sobrino facing the sea and the final escenita of the contest are perhaps too cloying moments, but cannot get tarnish the rest that will like to enjoy - like me - the ingenious comedy with curious characters and little moralina. "Little Miss Sunshine" has been lucky enough to get covered by the Sundance film festival, but I do not think that you stay long on the screens. At least, in cities such as Zaragoza. Take advantage and go to see it, it is worth the trouble.</body>
