	<body>"In London are producing a series of sabotage of unknown origin, cause, for the moment, only confusion." However, the police are behind an apparent honest man, who runs a film then.He is married to a good woman and living with her younger brother.A fruit bowl, which has the post near the cinema, is actually an agent of Scotland Yard that follows the steps of her husband, convinced that it is behind the sabotage plot."In effect, this is, and the heads of the plot require you to carry a powerful bomb at the center of the city, which could cause many deaths and real fear to the population."Excellent film of Hitchock, the best of the English stage. Some critics say that it is the best of that stage. I do not dare to say so, but it is a very interesting work that has already been printed the mastery of Hitchcock in recounting a tale of intrigue and suspense.Letting know things that the characters not, delights and makes the viewer experience by moving the springs available with ease and good rhythm. Moments like the brother of the protagonist being in his arms the powerful pump throughout the city, while we watch the hands of various wall clocks wherever he goes, get really may trouble us. For its part, get some great interpretations by Silvia Sidney and Oscar Homolka, as her husband.A film that has not aged and still retains the aroma of good cinema.</body>
