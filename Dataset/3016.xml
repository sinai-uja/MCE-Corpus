	<body>I will not extend more than what they needed. The Dennis Dugan movie is another bad example of American comedy. I am sorry guys, but increasingly I am sick over the matter. Yes, perhaps in this there are some original touch (if you can call) or perhaps a trial, without coming to story, noted for its rarez. Even the two main characters (this time man and man) come to be credible, although they do not entirely bad, just do what the public requests: pallasadas, some other face dramatic that we escape the lagrimilla and the rest, faceted simply bland. But at least we have to my (our) beloved Jessica Biel, which not only makes a very funny and well played role, but it is more beautiful than ever. The script, a bad experience, full of scenes that do not come to mind and characters left over greatly. Perhaps some other secondary funny, as the homosexual brother of Biel, the cure, the beggar of the wedding or Ving Rhames, but I assure you that the antics of Steve Buscemi (by the way, what here?) are incredibly pathetic. The reason of making a film about homosexuals? I do not know. The intention is good, but is disastrously (accident, forced request, badly drawn gay characters). To pass the time perhaps it is okay, but nothing more. Recommended to fans of American romantic comedies which are not against gay marriage.</body>
