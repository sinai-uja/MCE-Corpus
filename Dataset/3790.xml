	<body>The new proposal of the duo after the documentary Operación Triunfo, Balagueró/Plaza, us closer to the reality, showing us the point of view of the camera of a night television program. While it is true that we want to sell this proposal as something innovative and original, nothing further from the truth, as this format "invented it" or exploded with the sensational "The project of the Blair Witch", something became the most profitable film in history. The feeling of closeness with the characters is very large, since we see the same as them, but one of the weaknesses of the film is Manuela Velasco. Despite receiving a nomination in the Goya, and winning the award for best actress at the last festival of Sitges, I can hardly believe I, and there we have a problem, and good fat. In addition, other characters do not make credible. The combination of terror, anxiety and anger, with diametrically opposed elements such as laughter, jokes and tranquility, are part of this proposal, that is true, it helps us to relax, and more, when we have a good time without having a static framing, not just work at all. Taking references to "28 weeks later", "The Blair witch project" Romero films, have sold us the film of terror of the moment, and the supposed most we were going to have an impact. I have to say, it is quite far from the reality, since they fail to get the fear in the body, nor feel empathy with the characters. That Yes, the great campaign of marketing, with its two great trailers, been that Spanish Cinema go increasing followers, even in movies (fantasy), and that "Rec" has become one of the films over the blockbuster of the year.</body>
