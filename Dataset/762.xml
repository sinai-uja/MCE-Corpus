	<body>Here we have the classical family of the profound America which shows United around a group of boys who cut, thus celebrating the festive spirit of a common sentiment.Action us back until the year 1969. Between dreamy images which will result in a kind of discouraging Mirage, the film raises a walk by macabre deductions and nothing clean murders. It reveals as an exercise in synthesis on the origins of one of the most acclaimed and feared film legends.This story marks the approach of which was narrated recently on the occasion of the revision of the classic Texas Chainsaw Massacre. A film whose main purpose is the responses and not be misleading with regard to its principles. It is why what you applaud its director, by not betraying the spirit of a kind of cinema that has many followers, especially adolescents, and is most commonly consumed between ranging one weekend night.As film product is not surprising: the realization is intended to highlight the isolation in a rural landscape with roads semi-deserted and suspicious characters that encourage even more uncertain clashes. The parade of viscera, members separated from their bodies and blood flowing unchecked can be more weary that annoying, following the footsteps of recent as Saw, Hostel, Creep titles. An example of the counterattack? gore?
