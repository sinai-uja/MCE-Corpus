	<body>Superb film of Paul Haggis. Excellent script (well-deserved Oscar for best original screenplay), which deals with racism in a direct way, real, openly. and from all points of view: are not the targets the buds always, also black is automarginan (I mean the dialogues of young black, or the "purchase" of the inspector, when he himself said before that "you would not buy as a boldface".)Mount perfect, with a combination of stories, to each of which better, with some fantastic performances (Sandra Bullock and Brendan Fraser acted really!), and an end to the height, with which no doubt viewers will reflect on the total of the film.Memorable scenes (for those that have seen: that of the girl when he comes out of his house.) and the aforementioned script and interpretations, make this movie one of the best in recent years.That Yes, the only downside that I could put is that in some cases it can be pretentious, I mean, as if really the director knew that he is making a good movie and would like to prove it. Why, my score is 9.Sin doubt, I left the cinema really contento.y look lately is difficult.</body>
