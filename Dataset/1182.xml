	<body>Third (and so far final) installment of the adventures of the characters that Bryan Singer took to the big screen 6 years ago, now with the relay of Brett Ratner as director, and with part of the protagonist of the two previous films cast; It is true that note still "work" in production of Singer, as it retains its potential and/or narrative style, as well as the visual, though, on the other hand, perhaps Ratner does some kind of style? In this installment is tilda everything a little more dramatic than in the precedents, we are witnessing the disappearance of several heroes to those who in one way or another we got love in his previous appearances on screen, it is this tape, rather than possible closure to the saga (although then there is more than one Spin Off starring Wolverine)(, or by any other Member of the patrol X).Normal actors, much or little, nor to go mad (who said "G men") and is that you unless the debutantes, the majority of the actors is them comfortable sees a character are already 6 years approaching the public, by the way, the brotherhood of mutants malignant where have awakened them? Is it the same be mutant to be tacky? Before concluding, I do not like anything the score John Powell has composed for the film, with a dramatic air of "Antena 3 Telefilm" bordering the absurd, I liked most of John Ottman's second delivery, especially the "suite" that opened the film and the CD and which served as almost a "fanfare" in this saga of Marvel.</body>
