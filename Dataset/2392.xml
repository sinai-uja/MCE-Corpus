	<summary>An invitation to reflection on the values of the human being and its ability to react and act accordingly in limit situations.</summary>
	<body>When three Americans are known during a rampant and initiatory trip which leads them by various Asian countries, among which are Malaysia, little or nothing could make them think its excesses and his love of the herb, could play them the trick which eventually saw them in a country that severely punishes the simple fact of being found in the possession of the same.Framed within the dramatic genre and deep philosophical ramifications, return to paradise escarba in the depths of human nature and encourages reflection on the limits of loyalty, honesty and the co-responsibility of the person for their peers.Joaquin Phoenix emphasizes on its co-stars with a character who although it is not the main of the film by minutes of appearance, is by transcendence, and dramatic merit. Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche, without reaching the levels of Phoenix, not clashing, and in general is that the work of the cast is good, as well as the work of Joseph Ruben to address when he did this work, I enjoyed the revenues and the successes that had reported the train of money and sleeping with his enemy assault.Great photography in the scenes that take place in Malaysia and the lighting contrasts that are used at certain times, work together to intensify the feeling of anguish that at times transmits the film.In any case, it's an entertaining movie and encourages the Viewer to reflect, though after seeing carefully twice, I still have the feeling that you are missing something; something that I am not right to define, but that makes me to stay somewhat dissatisfied.</body>
