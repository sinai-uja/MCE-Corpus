	<body>Mr Baumbach was known for making films with Eric Stolz, go curriculum. What happens is that the shadow / influence of Wes Anderson is elongated, and after working together on the screenplay of The life aquatic, Noah Baumbach has directed his masterpiece.Emotional, Martian, hard, aggressive, fast, energetic, fun, real, biting, ironic. all this in a little (very little) more than eighty minutes. What a lucky remix of women and husbands, the Tenenbaum and Kramer against Kramer, a priori seem to a lot of drawbacks are transformed into an honest proposal of well-understood indie.All stratospheric actors in some papers that are made to suit and in which everyone, including children (huge, Owen Kline) give everything. Photography in 16 mm of Robert D. Yeoman, usual Anderson and now Manolete, gives that touch eighties in NY that inevitably we evokes Woody Allen.La soundtrack also is very Tenenbaum. Easily one of the best films of the year.A 9´5. (and that leaves a Baldwin) do by what far superior to American films beauty (see the ice storm or this history of Brooklyn), are so different Fortune?</body>
