	<body>The recipe for Disney was that the viewer should make him laugh as many times as crying. It would be a recipe of fifty percent, but I think that no one is placed according to the proportion. There are who complains of soft film and who complains of both joke seeing the same movie. The name of the director influences. If it is important as Spielberg we left that it puts us as muffins and then take you the blame to our liking. To me, the proportion tells me things about the authors. The "without reservation" like to suffer a bit.Zeta-Jones plays a Cook of high-level whose culinary talent is inconsistent with a zero interest in human relations. His boss forced to go to a psychoanalyst, but two changes are in its grid world which is going to change. The death of her sister forced to take charge of a niece of ten years, and in his absence, appears in the kitchen a chef like habil she, but with the gift of people that she is missing.The niece interprets the little Miss Sunshine, with their huge big clear eyes. I don't know if it does Celestina because without her aunt would remain the same, or if it is the protagonist, because you eat the screen.Borges said that a novel of the future you servíría to see how the world has changed in that time. "Without reservation" says of our century that to the Gallants already useless them for anything candy, and that if they want to fall in love with the players they have another remedy that show clearly whether they are legal or if they aren't.</body>
