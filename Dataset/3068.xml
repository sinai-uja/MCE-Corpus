	<summary>Similar to the other film (is inevitable to not talk about one without talking about the other), will win with viewing and commenting among friends, because the first impression with which one is is that it is great, Yes, but not for both.</summary>
	<body>Yesterday in my criticism on "Fido" spoke in passing of "Zombies Party" and as the actors Simon Pegg &amp; Nick Frost have become "world famous" thanks to this movie, it is normal that comes another film of this duo (which is a trio with its director), and if the previous spoofed horror and zombie cinema, here his teeth biting action cinema, more specifically the blockbuster like "2 rebel policemen" or "Call him Bodhi" of which one of the protagonists to talk, so like any "Buddy Movie" self-respecting, even to the great Chuck Norris.Imagino that this film is the kind that win in their viewing and that, as one sees her and her comments with friends in quality (and laughs) WINSSince a server, just be has laughed 3 times in the almost 2 hours of footage, and that for this type of comedy is something not very good.It is true that both Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are great, the zombies first party was a "peazo of vague" and is now a "Superpolic√≠a" (at times reminds me Danny Glover in the "Lethal weapon" series), the other repeats almost both the zombies in this role, and is that not another role may be asked to Nick Frostgiven his face and his physical complexion.Note also the presence of Jim Broadbent, Timothy Dalton, Paddy Considine and Steve Coogan, in addition to the small cameo by Martin Freeman and Bill Nighy, and just as Santiago Segura does in torrent, it's normal that Edgar Wright displayed on screen to their "buddies".Anyway, that like the other film (is inevitable to not talk about one without talking about the other), will win with viewing and commenting among friends, because the first impression with which one is is that it is great, Yes, but not for both.</body>
