	<body>Ratatouille is a lively sensory game. Pixar plays with the food mixing very realistic effects that come to see organic. The food is tasty enough to hunger in the world of the film is completely cartoonish Jeckle rats and some ghost back illustration.What is better played this film are its moments silences, of well used comedy. But I am still afraid that it is the pelí of Pixar's more sermons and articulated morals. Not compared to the cunning that finding Nemo uses to tell the story and present his characters. Alfredo Lingüini is a very clumsy young aspiring in the kitchen garbage collector until intersects with Remy gifted rat of good taste. The gifts of good smell of Remy makes a successful chef of the overnight and, still common in the film, let the character main fairly level. The only character that has a deep moment of change is the culinary critic Anton Ego. Far my favorite character in his dark stylized with huge dark circles and superlargos fingers. Next to reveal us about critics no more than that which has always been suspected: that the enjoyment by pointing out how bad does not mean taste for good.Likewise this film you can forgive is him his faults because it makes many delicious things at least. It is for children, which is no longer always the case in animated films. And it's definitely of good taste.</body>
