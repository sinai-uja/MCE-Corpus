	<body>Steven Soderbergh is back with the third part of the adventures of Danny Ocean and his. On this occasion, the boys of George Clooney have the mission to avenge the honour of his colleague Reuben at nothing less than Al Pacino. To this "Godfather", so together we return to see familiar faces, including fellow of mafia and range as Andy Garcia. The feminine touch is borne by the always interesting and suggestive Ellen Barkin.Sin more objective than trying to settle scores with Pacino, boys (and Soderbergh) give us a film entertaining, in which we can contemplate its different tricks to carry out its mission.Different scenes that show different situations, some of them with great comic content as the stage in the Mexican factory and the revolt which is organized, or stormy stay responsible for giving the score to the casino. That nobody intends to find stories or transcendental themes, "Ocean´s thirteen" is what it is, pure entertainment accompanied by a gang of big and famous actors, surrounded by luxury, money and much picaresque.</body>
