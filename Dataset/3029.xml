	<body>To hart√≥n Eastern films we carry, and unwittingly also. The first film I think that I've seen, but not entire. Begins with a man who is collecting orphans (formalized thus passed to the Duke of Feria and ended with the bones in jail) to teach them to the sword. Them is becoming murderers to such an extent, that last day of class have to give katanazos the more friend murderer have. Dog life.The film is located in the eastern Japan that every day we are surprised, truffled ninjas and clans who want to melt the emperor at all costs. Total, that these are Azumi and another boy continued to make that commanded the master, which is nothing more that give issue to the sword. In one of the battles, a boy who looks much Azumi he discovers his best friend that went through the sword long. Is he? Is not it?To be a second part, the truth that is not bad film. The argument is quite simple, Azumi picks up the sword and goes everywhere massacring anyone who gets him ahead. Easy. The downside of this is that it has a sweet face and refined manners who does not put me in the idea that it is a horrible killer. The rest of the characters give a tad of laughter, because they are not at all serious, if that don't Phooey. Fights are resultonas and the product has entertained me.In short, second installment of Azumi, who has to continue espadazos. For fans of the genre of struggles trail in Japan. Better have seen before the first.</body>
