	<body>I already say in advance that I I have not read the book by Christopher Priest, so I will not go to assess how good or bad adaptation is.Outstanding film by Christopher Nolan, after its acojonante 'Batman Begins', returns to look at the screen big. 'The Prestige' (sorry, I refuse to call it as her "translated" here, 'The final trick'.), the story of a battle between two wizards and a story of revenge to the exponent, boasts a huge ensemble cast that is huge and meets more than with his workheaded by a very large Hugh Jackman, God Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson, of which I speak a few lines below.Everything is very Nolan: excellent, with a very well-crafted script realization and Assembly and does a great job with the temporary jumps, as well as very well achieved an atmosphere and an intrigue. In addition, does not give it you any masticadito and suggests quite the Viewer after the screening, something that is appreciated in these times.The only weak point that I find is that, perhaps, depending on the patience of one, can be a little larguita.</body>
