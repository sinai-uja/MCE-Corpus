	<body>STALLONE seemed doomed to oblivion after failures of caliber of the protector, killers, GET CARTER, specialist etc.No doubt the veteran performer and director kept an ACE in the manga who apparently knows playing with success. Recoveries of two mythical characters in the decades of the 1970s and 1980s where Kingdom with RAMBO and ROCKY. Last year gave the stroke with the new delivery of the Boxer why returns to try to repeat experience with RAMBO where again is in charge of everything, direction, script, production and of course the interpretation.Accompanies it JAMES BROLIN signed for the hit series hotel, of course you are not going to ask this film a developed script, great performances, nor much less well defined characters. This is RAMBO and all that spare, come back with a very characteristic of the 1980s dirty action with blood to baskets something which undoubtedly serves to make fans delight Al Gore.The film gives what is expected of the no frills art from the beginning into a spiral of savage violence that fans will appreciate.Again I repeat that this is RAMBO anyone who wants to see film of high rank to be a cycle of WOODY ALLEN.</body>
