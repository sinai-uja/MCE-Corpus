	<summary>Why are Germans reviewing this sad part of its history?</summary>
	<body>Sophie Scholl - the latter day (Germany, 2005) is one of the nominees for the Oscar in the best foreign film category. She tells a little-known truth: that there were young Germans that rebelled against Nazism, seeking to inform the rest of the German population of the absurdities of Adolf Hitler on the pointless massacre in the war, about the murder of thousands of Jews. Young as Sophie and Hans Scholl, brothers who died in the guillotine for their ideals. The film chronicles the last six days of their lives. His crime? His treason? Having distributed leaflets against Nazism in the University and not betraying their pacifist group "White rose" classmates.The actions of the protagonist, Julia Jentsch, is strong, serene, notable, an interpretation that screams: courage! It is said that the Academy is claiming the previous version of the Oscar, when it was included in the same category to the German film, the fall (2004), which showed the "nice" side of Hitler and Nazism, which injured some sensitivities.Outside that reasonable suspicion for me Sophie Scholl was a good movie, but I wouldn't say excellent. Maybe it's that I'm a little tired of the subject of Nazism and the obvious control of the Jews in the film industry. When you can, you can ($ $$). Also leads me to wonder because the Germans are reviewing cinematically that sad part of its history, now more than ever. Perhaps they have always done and the global distribution was not that of now, I do not know.</body>
