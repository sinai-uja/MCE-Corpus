	<summary>A romantic comedy that, based on a fairly original premise, ends up doing waters by the stupid habit of having to finish all of them with the heavy and overused "happy end".</summary>
	<body>We have the typical film love to my wife, I am surprised by their own initiative and without his usual toward this type of film pressure have I seen, let us not deceive ourselves, Jennifer Garner in the poster and as absolute protagonist is sufficient thrust for losing almost 2 hours viewing.A surprise (I always get curious and it seems that you repeat more than garlic), that the tape starts so dramatically go tarring and turning into one comedy more of the lot, and that, little by little, the original premise is quite good; bride loses her future husband in a car accident and thanks to the friends of this begins to learn all that, hidden by him, not met in vida.Â¿La paste? And there is enough, it's waters, which advocates too easily makes the script to the "tor world is Bueno" (which said Manolo Summers, RIP) and that lawyers towards the "happy End" of this type of production the film one end almost almost with the same face, the same feelings, with which he began viewing.We certainly have one of these tapes of consumption quickly, with Jennifer Garner (it has operated los morros?), Timothy Oliphant (the actor that will give life to the hero of the game "Hitman"), Kevin Smith in State of grace (perhaps the best of the movie are their many jokes), and Juliette Lewis, such as closure of the campus. By the way, I found it fun to find Fiona Shaw, the already famous Aunt Petunia "Harry Potter" as mother of Jennifer Garner in this film.Anyway, without extending me too, a romantic comedy that, based on a fairly original premise, ends up doing waters by the stupid habit of having to finish all of them with the heavy and overused "happy end".</body>
