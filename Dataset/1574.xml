	<body>Giovani Veronesi with 32 scripts to their backs, 10 films directed and performed 5, arrives with the continuation of the italianamente famous "Amore Manuale", film of little impact on Spain (I think that this gives it the climate), but very famous in Italy and the rest of Europa.Hay who highlight that this Italian film exceeds its predecessor in all aspects (Manuale dÂ´amore). The actors (including Elsa who I think has done the best role of her fateful career) are enormous, the screenplay is fresh, fast, fun and the movie has some spectacular levels, as for example those of Monica Belucci just at the end, without words I was to see it. Fantastic makeup (subtle, invisible, natural), endearing band sound e insist a great script.I recommend highly to see her in original version, it can be a little heavy at first but when the ear is usually is much better, as you can appreciate all the viz comic already alone has Italian tonality. By the way that Elsa Pataki, passes successfully this course with a great accent.The great Belucci is a Panther of the camera is as always spectacular, but as you say the full cast is beautifully directed.The film rocks you between comedy and drama in a delicious way, no doubt an experience which you will not regret to say what they say some. Your make case to the ironcita.</body>
