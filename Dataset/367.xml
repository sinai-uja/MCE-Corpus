	<summary>Funny comedy set in the world of the engine, which will not lay the foundations of the 7th art.</summary>
	<body>Simple Entertainment starring Will Ferrell, John C. Reilly, Michael Clarke Duncan, Sacha Baron Cohen, typical tape which you can not ask nothing more than entertain, where the characters are caricatured and carry to the limit.Will Ferrell in his line (those who have seen "the reporter" will know what I mean), Sacha Baron Cohen is perhaps the most sympathetic character in the movie, giving life to the villain of the same, making of afrancesado gay.The scenes of motor, directly taken from the American Nascar (those who have seen Cars will know what I mean) give the film an air of freshness and action not we saw on screen from "Days of Thunder" Tom Cruise.En end, a funny comedy set in the world of the engine, will that not lay the foundations of the 7th Art (rather)(, and as I often say "of 7th cinema") but that entertains, and in the times in which we are to leave the brain for an hour and a half outside our routine concerns, well deserves.</body>
