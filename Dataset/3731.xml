	<summary>We breathe the good vibes and the desire to have fun in the footage.</summary>
	<body>One of the producers more outstanding and certainly politically incorrect in the amateur scene with titles as prominent as the devil or zombie Real clockwise to stir among many others.These natives return to demonstrate his great sense of humor in a film that parodies with great showcasing the old adventures of karate and the famous tournaments, with a sense of rhythm that no lapses in no time, even the technical effects are really well made for the budget they handle, you can breathe the good vibes and the desire to have fun in the footage.A wave of laughter from start to finish that makes me admire them a little more in the line of death in Torremolinos karate but superior.</body>
