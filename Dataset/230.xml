	<body>With an argument more widespread than a public water (with forgiveness), the film presents the problems that arise when a couple marries and their respective children are forced to live together. Compounding the problem in this case is that it's an overly large family (the mother has 10 children: biological 4 more adopted 6-8 fr.). The conflict of coexistence is evidente.Â¿No you remember the plot of numerous Spanish series Los Serrano or family physician? I do not know to fund the panorama of American television series but I guess it's a recurrent plot in fiction when there is a lack of ideas. With a final and a totally predictable plot development, the comic tone of the tape only arises from the spectacular falls of the characters or the Pringle with liquids of disgusting appearance.And if, the film is littered with topics (as daughter Chinese or Japanese obsessed with the photograph), and scenes that resemble other films as the naval captain that educates their children with the righteousness of his profession ("smiles and tears"). This righteousness of the father collides with educational freedom proposed by the mother. The guys come together despite their differences against their common enemy: his parents, and organize a strategy to separate them. Perhaps the only emotional scene worth is the lighthouse that develops when the movie finishes (do not follow to not crush the end nobody) the rest are a series of sequences that plunge sharply towards a predictable and watered-down end.</body>
