	<body>Acceptable comedy that is neither good, nor much less, but elite generally.The truth is that, while maintaining many of the constant negative of the Yankee comedy in the recent past (last too), is made with taste, not much imagination, but it is effective in learning the smile and sometimes the laughter of the audience.It is quite irregular, starting well and continuing on this path, during just over half an hour. However, little by little the movie stagnates, being his comical somewhat leaden seal, repetitive and quite chorra (in my opinion, and not wanting to offend, eye!).Scenes are already pretty views in other movies of the same hair, where join gags, achieved little, with the pure romantic comedy that does too much grace, not to be at times as the fun party of doubles tennis, (frame 1) quite humorous despite the fact that it is not original. But the truth is that it makes laugh of the lindoEn the part end, if with the exception of his tontísimo epilogue in charge of a comedy actor uncredited in the film, the pace again to upload, and attended a few scenes well solved technically, with an excellent Assembly and a soundtrack that recalls the best films of intrigue and action.But ultimately, is not very beyond this film, although it is nice as a whole and pleasant view, despite its simplicity.Billy Bob Thornton and John Heder do well and are credible in their roles, as well as secondary, as the director Todd Louiso.</body>
