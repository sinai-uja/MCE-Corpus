	<summary>Hodgepodge of terror French</summary>
	<body>Fuck that crappy of boarding school. The movie does not begin badly and the presentation of the main character, which is undoubtedly the orphanage, an impressive House in the countryside, is very precocious, full of nuances and with too much light for a film of this genre. The House scares at first sight and the courtyard surrounding nor falls short; they were the most important ingredient to make a good horror movie, but what they have missed. Surprised the good French production and surprised the beauty of the main protagonist, but not these. The script is a humbug, passes through several stages that range from more to less and ultimately ends bored. Be grateful that if that have not resorted to the sangraza and the various viscera to give "more afraid", a resource that is already seen but running in house of wax.The key scene of the boarding school is when it arrives from the lift to the white room. It is so predictable, resources are so basic that seems a calque of thousand films and at the point the final peak more than be scary, laugh. A pity because the boarding school began very well but in the end is long and boring.</body>
