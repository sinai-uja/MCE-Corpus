	<body>In a film that, a priori, is closer to the world of Poker, esparaba receive some kind of feeling. When I noticed that the protagonist was "mesmerized" by letters in his desire to win and play at any price, I thought it might be interesting. But I was discovering that "Lucky You" falls apart like a House of cards when it gradually consumed me boredom.Curtis Hanson I excited in "L.A. confidential" extent to cause forced reading the book which was based (well above, even the film). However, on this occasion it away completely their right direction to leave us a sosa and boring film, without any surprise. To such an extent that any aficionado of the pocker might hate it and switch to bocce.Although in principle, we can attract history facing two expert players of pocker, father and son, who are capable of giving up anything by the fact of winning, at 30 minutes of the film immerses us in a State of lethargy that extends to the final 120 minutes which lasts for the film. And is that neither the father, played by Robert Duval, nor the son (Eric Bana) not even the girl in love with the protagonist (Drew Barrymore) are able to convey something other than boredom. This also help both long and lacking sense dialogs and the boring soundtrack. Not even own allocations pocker have rhythm, emotion or tension. So the end result is a "pair of twos" which do not reach, not even close, win this game to indifference.</body>
