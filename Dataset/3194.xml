	<summary>Nice British comedy with genuine English taste. Sparkling dialogues, endearing characters and crazy situations arising for the sake of a hallucinogenic substance intake.</summary>
	<body>Nice comedy with the pleasant aroma of the genuine English film which virtually disappeared with the former and missed Ealing Studio. Here, given the times, humour it contains abundant concomitancias more, as well as a couple of eschatological scenes which, frankly, are the best of the film. A film that, in what in my regard, takes a while to enter in the field, being a poquillo sosa at first. They are the scenes in which we discover the various characters, very necessary for understanding and delectation of what will happen next.And it is that, as they pass the minutes, it becomes more and more fun, with moments descacharrarrantes, reaching an end simply descojonante. This is due to a right direction of the American Frank Oz, who already had experience in narrating the vicissitudes of unconventional people, and a group of British performers, as well as the nature of New Jersery Peter Dinklage, comprising his roles with simple mastery. Since people here and now quite unknown to distinguished veterans as Peter Vaughan as the ineffable Uncle prevented in a wheelchair.A movie with sparkling dialogues, endearing characters and crazy situations arising for the sake of a hallucinogenic substance intake. It is less more and leaving the viewer has a smile from ear to ear. Totally recommended.</body>
