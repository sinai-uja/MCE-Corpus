	<summary>Another mediocre movie for the saca, this animation on the decline, few studies retain the ability to make good animated films.</summary>
	<body>Today I will analyse another animated film? its title, mad by the Surf, and is the alternative of Sony Pictures before the proposal of Disney, Ratatouille. If you talk about artistic pretensions? do in this film shine by their ausenciaEstamos before a movie that makes boot us from time to time some smile, with a plot that takes spending nauseam? Do an artistic competition, the main character becomes the best, after a long apprenticeship with a retired jāmī who had lost hope? and her recovers thanks to his young apprentice. The moral of always? which still gets in so many films based on sports.Do that if, the presented the story, is very well managed, that it comes to be a kind of documentary in which there are interviews with the protagonists, interviews with children (children penguins, of course), flat recuperated to simulate the camera is in the film, even missing any object that has an impact on the camera? The characters are quite friendly and focus on surf (do surf, beach, Sun? do penguins?), makes it a refreshing, perfect film for these summer dates, if you have already seen his Disney.Pasemos rival now paragraph technical? is impeccable, water and character animation is very good, there is no doubt of that, but we need much more than a 3D animation to make a movie?As a conclusion, another mediocre movie for the saca, this animation on the decline, few studies retain the ability to make good animated films (and when I say few? I mean any of Dreamworks and Pixar). Do the kids of the House and I mean 0-6 will enjoy this film? but there are other quite more succulent proposals for 6 or older.</body>
