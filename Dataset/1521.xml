	<body>This new film from the factory Telespan and David Serrano intends to make the film the main theme of this film. But the film of the 1970s. More specifically the year 77. And of course, tell me as it happened has created a style that marks both these "nostalgic" productions and the landing of Normandy Spielberg later war production. Only that in the latter case, the message is clear and acceptable.Federico Solá (Alberto San Juan) wants to direct his first screenplay in film. The producer, José María Culebras (Miguel Rellán) get a folk (Nathalie Poza) for the role protagonist. Production, from that small imposition, turns into a disaster.A film about the world of the film may be a large acid portrait as "The game of Hollywood", Robert Altman, but when is treated with banality and keeping in mind a pseudo-artístico and quasi-political discourse is a comedy in which you do not laugh and a panfletillo there is no who is created.The background of this film, apart from giving a stereotypical image of the world of cinema, its source of funding and professionals, tries to tell us that the commercial cinema is rubbish. A rubbish ending us enjoying it, but it is not art. Come on, the campaign that Resines and the "snails" in the game of baseball.But is that what the "creators" of this film, in an effort to be "cool" do not realize that criticize everything you have done so far, i.e. "The other side of the bed", "The two sides of the bed" and "Days of football": commercial script without chicha, superficial film and tontorrón, but that generates lots of money and applause from the audience.</body>
