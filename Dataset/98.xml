	<body>Penalty which has not made this film Pajares, that since then we enfrentariamos to a rejoice and a folleteo and a license from the first frame. And of course, it is that you see the poster and it airs a miss with the back and you think "I tell the missus that we will see this and everybody's happy". And ends you're thinking "ande are topless ladies!". And it is that, apparently, love and nudes are like oil and water for American filmmakers.The film is about Casanova, the most flirtatious of all time (after Pajares, I insist). It begins with him old telling us a little of his life. NA, normal, that if beat in duel with one, if saved in extremis from the gallows, that if trajina to a nun, who was trajina to another, that if to another, that if to another. Poor man, would you dry up the cord. Then the film is twisted and aims towards a love that he has and that rejects him. And that, until the most handsome, cannot resist it.Well, let's see. As I expect little, me has pleased the film. The atmosphere seems very good, with its impossible costumes (in particular is the Duke) and selected and outdated dialogues. He has an air of modernity, because but would be unbearable. But the film itself is not hooked. To begin with, show us old Casanova, so you know that it does not die. Then, as we move forward, we can clearly see how will end matched all remaining points. But since then, can be seen much better than others on the Billboard. In short, a light comedieta for those stupid days.</body>
