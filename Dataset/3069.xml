	<body>"Hero" is going to be perhaps one of the shorter criticisms do. Why? Because it is a waste of time to comment on a film as well. Let's go by parts: the address: arrogance. Actors: I say more than bright brilliant (look at those (impressive) fight scenes). Screenplay: Although "simple" (for lack of a better word) the director takes all the juice delighting us for 100 minutes passed flying. Photography, the art direction, staging are. pufff. imagine. as explain it?. What would the word?. Despite vulgar pareceer will say: Orgasmic Paul.The martial arts scenes removed hiccups and all the others. The soundtrack will the film like a glove and never takes protagonism to the images, which complements in an excellent way.In a few lines would say that "Hero" is a (good) example of good cinema, one of those movies that only with the images does not leave sitting and watching the screen gawk until that just the end credits.</body>
