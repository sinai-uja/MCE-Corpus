	<summary>Comes a "key" in the history of time itself forced, that force which is now forced, justifying it in the script with a single sentence of a character with less depth and intelligence that Peter Griffin.</summary>
	<body>Cassandra's dream continues with the current londinenca of Match Point "serious" line, but is very far from that. The address is correct, but loses quite a few kilos of bellows as it progresses the film. Dialogues I liked, but there are some pretty pretentious and good cheap moralina any movie desktop may contain. In addition, the history is nothing out of this world, and it is forzadísima. And if we didn't have enough, brings a "key" moment in history that force which already is forced, justifying it in the script with a single sentence of a character with less depth and intelligence than Peter Griffin.Por not to mention the end (which is so suddenly that one gets the feeling that the tito Woody moved escopeteao towards Barcelona unfinished film)(, leaving her at the mercy of the technical team, that he managed as he could) and cast, quite limitadillo, especially the duo protagonist Colin Farrell (absolutely pathetic) and Ewan McGregor, which demonstrates once again that, although he has charisma and is handsome, is a man with only a couple of interpretative records.Everything they've released would make anyone think that the film I did not like anything at all. It is not true. Found me a salvageable for the minimum film, you know to capture the viewer's attention during his footage, and does not seem fair to cancel it (peladísimo 5). In addition, this creative maturity of Allen of recent years, where everything is elegant and sophisticated, dazzles me. But ultimately, it turns out to be a rather disappointing film.</body>
