	<body>Neither cold nor heat has caused me the new film and Cronenberg, which tells us impeccably, with stellar performances, the history of mafiosi already thousand times.Indifference would be the right word to define my feeling after the viewing of this film, which wanted to see, but it has left me a bitter taste in the mouth.On the one hand we attended a master class of direction, accompanied by some impressive performances, but on the other, we find ourselves with a history tells us the same always, as always, and a somewhat disappointing end. The entire film is accompanied by a solid history with achieved dialogues, and a Mortensen that is out of the screen. Although it is the same basis, sobriety, credibility and robustness over 90 minutes is achieved, but inexplicably, Cronenberg is diluted a final promised intense and dramatic, which he is in correct and justito.At the end we are left with a film of book, essential in schools of cinema, because all visual and interpretative, but at the same time it all comes with a rest unattractive by being indifferent to use all watched topics and see in the mafia film.I can only highlight the actions of the Quartet protagonist, above all that of Viggo Mortensen. (Up Vincent Casell I liked, and that he always makes the same nose!), otherwise, highlight the great House of Cronenberg, the strength of the script and the indifferent final.</body>
