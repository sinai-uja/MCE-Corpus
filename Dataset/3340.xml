	<summary>It is not more than one of these loggerhead comedies that one forgets quickly and is ideal to see with a group of friends, a few pizzas and a good staff of cans of beer (or similar).</summary>
	<body>I love the new composition that has taken Digital plus, although in his fights with the sixth for the broadcast of football I have private see channel directed by Emilio Arag√≥n (and is that in my house we are not antenizados); and is that your channel comedy is excellent for a feast day lying on the couch watching movies. Finally,!TO THE NOUGAT!Another tape of those that I saw so many years ago, that he remembered many situations, but not 100% the same, and it is that, as I have said on hundreds of occasions, although Sandler I do not like excessively sympathetic, his film, thug and playful makes me reconcile with him and see his films with the biggest of smiles; and it is that the tape that brings us today is not more than one of these loggerhead comedies that one forgets quickly and is ideal to see with a group of friends, a few pizzas and a good staff of cans of beer (or similar).And it is that, since his argument, the son of the demon arrives at the Earth to apprehend his brothers who have come to do evil, accompanied by a dog, and in a rather peculiar way; the tape, rife with cinematic references has the addition of which was the first film to which Florentino Fernandez put some of the voices, without going further from the grandfather, played by Rodney Dangerfield (RIP), and that only appear on screen makes you share laughter.The tape has plenty of cameos, from Quentin Tarantino to Rob Schneider that always appears in all of his films in some role.</body>
