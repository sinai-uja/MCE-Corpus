	<body>"Clerks 2", a film which went companion and I never thought that I would like, more than anything because Kevin Smith until that I met my current partner gave me very bad luck, it turns out that the movie is very well. The first "Clerks" have to admit he I not enthusiastic at all, not I understood that it was intended to make the director with that aesthetic in black and white, or nor I understood social criticism with the acid humor that had in the movie. But with the passage of time, Kevin Smith has managed to have a personality as an author and in the case of "Clerks 2" make one comedy rather than fun, with an exquisite maturity is reflected in each of the dialogues and scenes. It is what I most stands out about him, his scripts, they are the basis of his film and what makes his films unique and at the same time the viewer Gets a good time with uncouth jokes but also feels identified with the world that surrounds him and some frika that appear during the film. Highlight the scene in which the subject we are discussing Star Wars vs. Lord of the rings, is a newcomer to interpret a Catholic, inocenton, geek named Elias who is the very best that has appeared on the screen lately and these gestures and grimaces of the silent Bob to make him as mythological as the critic in "The girl in the water", rather than endearing. A good option to stick a few laughter and so many learn to use gags in conditions without laugh track.</body>
