	<body>Markus Nispel presents an epic film, which could well resemble "Conan the barbarian", but that never reaches the category. I have to say that you it's a remake, which presents the experiences of a young Viking who is left on American soil and adopted by an indigenous family. After being accepted by the tribe, the boy grows up to become a warrior. One day your peace of mind (and yours) is cracked before the arrival of a new hour of Wild Viking.With this premise, people may think that it will be a thrilling film (with some features of "Apocalypto"), but they are not fooled. On this occasion, the adventure, the battles and the epic made elsewhere, that we cannot get in the skin of the character (played by Karl Urban), or move to the facts that we are witnessing. One of the few aspects that would highlight is the picture, as Daniel C. Pearl gives images an interesting dark (which also can take many detractors), that can camouflage the shortcomings of the script and carrying out a little, but dejan beautiful prints in the retinas of the Viewer.</body>
