	<summary>Colleagues in the forest does not have nor a couple of minutes that deserve the penalty to remember, or you encariñas with the characters, and Moreover, one passes the time and little lasting, looking forward to this end.</summary>
	<body>I am a lover of film animation, and it is that wherever I see, what's the animated film for children, it makes me want to boot the head of rennet, but, honestly, and for a time this part, this flurry of films bland, poorly, with a laughable argument but not power, with stories thousand views times, and where the buenhacer which leads (especially labour and care) a tape of animation behind, is vilified, because of an excess of little zeal when it comes to her, before, in my earliest childhood, how many films had a year of animation? Perhaps 2, maybe 3, but now, now every month, more or less planted us a couple of tapes, where, as I have already said, the originality is conspicuous by its absence, and is that "Colleagues in the forest" has no or a couple of minutes that deserve the penalty to remember, or you encariñas with the characters, and Moreover, one passes the time and little that lastslooking forward to this end.Warlords, cassettes of animation itself, but also tapes of (animation) of quality.</body>
