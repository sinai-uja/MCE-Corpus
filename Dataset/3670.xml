	<summary>And if all dejaramos out that being of evil that supposedly cohabits with us? Remember it well.</summary>
	<body>We continuos with a new film that explores that malignant internal side of the supposed that we possess all humans. If in the strange that there is in me, explored the ability of a person harm, by avenge the loss of a loved one, this time the motivation is quite different, since Mr. Brooks acts killing other people for an addiction. But I rather think that it is a mere excuse to flee her boring and lonely life and become someone who can control their own destiny and that of others.Both Kevin Costner interpretations, who believe that it is one of the best roles of his career, because it shows to perfection as though you want to resist killing, you cannot avoid to do it again and that is transparent in their eyes and in their gestures, like the of William Hurt, who makes an alter ego to perfection and can play with the feelings and emotions of Mr Brooks as if handled a game of chess.What most impresses you is that you get for a moment to understand the motivations that lead to that person to do such things, and therefore it is also important to the character that you are excited to see and done a crime with it, because somehow you also te pica the curiosity, the anxiety that we know everything.The only downside is that some scenes are excessively long and makes you heavy history, but it's good a momentary thing.It is not that I have forgotten that Demi Moore is also, but it is that the duo protagonist the supersedes both on screen, that did me not need nor that appear.</body>
