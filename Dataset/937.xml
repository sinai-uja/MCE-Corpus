	<summary>At the height of the stupid Jackass.</summary>
	<body>I am one of those people that do not see fall who falls, not only by the downturn in quality have had since he left Wyoming, but because actually it happened wrong watching it; get me embarrassed attacks. Is it that Borat did not call me no entry. The idea of a man posing as a reporter for Kazakhstan touring United States with the idea of ridicule to his country and the visited country it was difficult to make me grace. You have some time curious, as the confusion of a turtle with a dog, and other revealing moments in certain ways of thinking American, as the statements of the cowboy in the rodeo against homosexuals, or sellers of weapons and cars or inmuten when Borat tells them that he wants them to kill Jews, anything to sell.But apart from that I would not want because if the movie were really a documentary made with hidden camera, imagine a camera shooting certain sequences reveal that all, or nearly all, is a complete farce. I am convinced that Pamela Anderson knows perfectly what her role in the film before the time of the autograph and that everything is prepared, like the Jewish assumptions that rent them a room. We will, it is a movie that I do not think anything and which is the alutura of the stupid Jackass.</body>
