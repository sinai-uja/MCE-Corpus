	<summary>53 Winter days is a hard, bitter and depressing film complex assimilate even for the strongest spirits</summary>
	<body>The cinema is an art, it is but some do not like to admit it, it moves through stages, gusts, or as they say the most modern trends. For a few years, at least in the film Spanish, has returned the trend to make cinema that reflects reality, everyday, at all costs, to the extent that it comes to touching the mockumentary.This trend fits clearly 53 winter days, a film that aims to show the human soul and the difficulties which we are facing and how some are able to overcome them while others sink into absolute misery. He is not easy to see tape or easy to digest, that the three stories that are very dark and depressing. Judith Colell, in his effort to show the everyday life, gives the film a really excessive bitterness, sometimes free, made only to hearts and spirits strong and resistant. The script has serious ups and downs, and there are times where we don't know what motivates the characters to do what they do. Nor is there a great emotional development, and almost all the secondary characters are quite blurred, as if not had received them the necessary attention. The way in which the film is shot does not help the Viewer to focus on the story, being the little wise photography. Most notable is the work of an always shiny Mercedes Sampietro and a Álex Brendemühl which seems to be the actor fetish for the independent film Spanish. 53 winter days is a hard, bitter and depressing film complex assimilate even for the strongest spirits. Those courageous to go to see her leave of film vapuleados and sunk by the excesses of Judith Colell.</body>
