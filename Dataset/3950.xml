	<summary>The tape is not perfect, but certainly we have one of the great films of 2008.</summary>
	<body>True to the title and also expiando my sins in which in the movie buff refers (if it is that you can call you Sin end the year with "Saw 4" and start with "The Golden Compass") decided to do penance and at the same time redeem me with this movie, nominated for 7 Golden Globe (whose ceremony as well know not held by the already endless writers strike) and one of the more than likely candidate for the Oscars This year, it is that closer release a movie to the key month of February more options, and now is when we come cinema, in capital letters, leaving the "trash" commercial (and palomitera) for the rest of the year.As well, after my usual intro, which not always means something, but it tends to stay quite well, and that, for those who read me regularly, is almost part of the "seal of the House", go with my opinion on the film, an excellent drama romantic (and war) that will delight both of females attending cinemaas the "machorros" who believe that, once again, as a pig to slaughter, we're going to swallow the umpteenth romantic film of the year, we will find one of those movies that excite themselves and strangers.Perhaps, the only 2 notes negative that I see are, their exaggerated slowness and, it takes enough to enter in the field, is lost sometimes at levels irrelevant (seems to be a kind of rule not written by which all nominated films have to last at least 2 hours or more.), and convoluted to their fitting, do not know if it is he got me disoriented, or again I went to the cinema without glasses, or that I know myself, but somewhere that another occasion I had to ask my companions for that part of the plot were going.And now go with the good parties, on the one hand excellent performances by everyone from Keira Knightley to James McAvoy, through course Saoirse Ronan above all, who knows, with her huge blue eyes, and with his "evil child" fitted the most petty children's characters of the 7th art. On the other hand the great detail with which are careful sets, costumes, music (the score at some moments with the typewriter of Briony, as sound background.), as well as a picture of those that leave one with his eyes open wide during the slide.The tape is not perfect for these 2 mistakes which I have already outlined, but since then, we have a great movie, and given little film that I've seen what you have spent 2008 (only 2 films) will say that since then, if everything that I see now it equals the tape directed by Joe Wright, it will be for me this year one of the best years (in terms of quality) of cinema that visione.</body>
