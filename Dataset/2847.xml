	<body>Ironies of life, Argentine cinema has lived an era of splendor and expansion in the same years in which a very serious economic crisis whipped Argentina. Thanks to this revival, the general public has been able to meet major filmmakers such as Campanella or Bielinsky, recover others already enshrined as Aristarain, and discover excellent actors as Ricardo Darín, Eduardo Blanco, Mercedes Morán or Ulises Dumont.Muchos of these titles have been co-financed in lesser or greater extent by Spanish producers, which in turn have influenced their cinematic style. But tapes as Solos have come forward nearly of miracle, thanks to the commitment and tenacity of its directors, in this case José Glusman. Own account the history of Henry (Sergio Boris) and Luis (Adrián Navarro), two men of thirty and many forty or few, that they suffer from strong romantic disappointments and decide to live together. What had become a refuge for the sentences of both men, becomes a deep and sincere friendship. The main virtue of José Glusman is that it does not offer situations or stereotypical characters, but showing a credible story that anyone can recognize. Neither falls into the easy mindless singles American-style comedy which is very welcome. However, not opt not for the human comedy or drama, the film loses bellows as the minutes elapse. Good work of its partner lead, which brings even more greater credibility to the whole.Alone is a failed film, and despite having some good initial ingredients, it has become a slightly vulgar product, one of the lot. A real shame that wasted good make interpretive of their protagonists, and a script that could have given much more than themselves.</body>
