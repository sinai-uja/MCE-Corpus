	<summary>A film begins as round and just being square.</summary>
	<body>Lately the wisdom of Miss Berry choice movies is very much in question, while the later interpreted in "Catwoman" is on the decline and connects failure with failure as who ata a long cord, this time, and by joining another cord to the Strip, returned to do the same, accompanied of an already "viejuno" Bruce Willis, in narrow Thrillerthat puts in a home all the meat on the grill and the end is lost in a thousand byways that little matter to us and which end up being heavy, boring, little important and seen on more than one occasion, so a boat soon comes me to mind the tape starring Antonio Banderas and Rebecca Mornay "Never talk to strangers" how it relates to this that brings us a thousand Parallels.James Foley famous for legendary the who's that girl? He starred in a Madonna jovencisima, here lost the roles as a director, not getting or print the pace at which the film needs, or with good casting that has, do the most minimum to get a good result to the tape, disservice the script, that makes him more than surprise bored and sucks.In short, a tape starts being round and it just being square.</body>
