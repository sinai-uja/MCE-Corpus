	<body>"I am Legend" ('I am leyend', 2007) of Francis Lawrence is an entertaining tape of action that surely copar√° the ranking of box-office in the upcoming dates.Francis Lawrence had debuted with the mediocre "Constantine" (2005), a Hollywood adaptation of the character created by Alan Moore on Swamp Thing. In his adaptation little remained of nihilism and roughness of its reference paper and opted to spectacular and grandiose leaving a failed and discreetly entertaining work.Now Lawrence adapts the famous story by Richard Matheson in the same way, looking for fast-paced action and spectacular. And within the range of current rompetaquillas meets its mission of entertain and have fun without thinking much. A product of these features nobody seeks the fidelity with the original work and here there although the end (excluding the epilogue) if guarda similarity to the original. "I am Legend" is enjoyed during its first hour of footage when it shows us the daily life of Robert Neville (Will Smith) in a deserted New York Cityonly accompanied by his dog and lapses in the flashbacks and interest in the last third of the footage. It is told with verve and even has some moment of suspense that is appreciated but basically is a vehicle for Will Smith in the likeness of "I robot" (2004, Alex Proyas), film correctly, with a visually solvent director, with scenes of masses (these flashbacks totally unnecessary), action, racing and shooting, which is what it is. We change robots Proyas film by infected humans (a cross between vampires and zombies), close to the videoclip aesthetics and already have made equation, success assured. Anyway he entertains and is short (thanks) and the digital effects Department has done a great job.</body>
