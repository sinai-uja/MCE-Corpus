	<body>Go! I just found out now that the Church and the ultracatólicos groups recommend not go see the movie because it is a criticism to the Church. And I came here to recommend not going to see it because it is a sovereign boredom, and it is has a critique to the Church that I could not enjoy because I neither learned. How sad that above with the controversy do you a favor (because we know that with these things earn spectators rather than get lost) and also undermine the gaze of the poor and stupid Viewer, which already finds difficult it to go with the mind open to the film that goes over to see something that isn't, find three feet to the cat and ask José Luis Perales to Olmo.La Luis peli is a round trip of pot in that there is an alternate universe where each person has a pet in which his soul is deposited (hmmm, that almost describes the real world, now that I realize, with old with their poodle, ragged hippipunkis with its hungry Wolf dogs, MariCarmen and their puppets.), where a girl travels to the North Pole to provoke a war between Bruges, polar bearsSiberian and Gypsies and to save other children from being subjects of experiments with their mascotalmas. Ah! And the excuse of everything are a magical powder that connect different universes. To make matters worse the movie abruptly ends, i.e., not just because I guess expected appears a sequel soon, which I declinaré kindly go see claiming to have forgotten this first part.PS: Not, nor Daniel 'James Bond' Craig or Eva 'Bond Girl' Green save the film because, to increase fraud, just a few minutes. Ah! And Nicole Kidman 'Botox' is appalling.</body>
