	<summary>Horrific, made for out of step, poorly planned, worse shot and that transmits not a shred of emotion.</summary>
	<body>I admit that when it opened not called me attention and I was postponi√©ndola with a solid "already fall" because that wasn't a movie that could qualify as a Saint of my devotion, today that finally I've seen, felt me horrific, made out of step, poorly planned, worst shot and that transmits not an iota of emotion, that everything that happens on the screen you are unconcerned.It seems that since 9-11 (and in Madrid the subsequent 11-M) firefighters have become heroes (but were already) of American cinema, so that to some listorro of Hollywood was passed by the idea this film to honor the profession (excellent, on the other hand) of these characters that are dedicated to saving lives, the pity is that the result is a decent TV desktop telefilmIt is saved from burning or issued directly in DVD by the presence of Travolta and Phoenix are true "cache" actors.Once I have finished (to harsh penalties) of viewing it, glad to have not done at the time. !God that penalty of film!</body>
