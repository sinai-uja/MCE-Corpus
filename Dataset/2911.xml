	<body>Very interesting and necessary film of complaint about the bloody "war" between hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda, Africa, in the year 1994. There were killed nearly a million people, in their vast majority Tutsis at the hands of the machetes of hutus. The gravity of the matter was that no nation of the civilised world took charge of the protection of innocent civilians, leaving them to their fate.This film denounces these acts honestly and entertaining, with historical rigor and a way of narrating using suspense, with a very accomplished tension and some commendable performances.It is worth seeing the great Don Cheadle in their difficult role.A good movie that perhaps in the hands of another more experienced director would have been better, but that is necessary to ensure that Western countries take awareness and not return to turn our backs on millions of innocent people.In summary, a sensational film which does not leave indifferent and with one of the best performances of the year, Don Cheadle.</body>
