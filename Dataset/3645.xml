	<summary>An excellent classic eighties that is worth remembering.</summary>
	<body>On Friday, while playing the new Buzz of Playstation 2 (Buzz Hollywood) I found a film about one of my favorite directors, John Hudges where a reminder did a review on the most successful of his filmography, between this "Crooks at all pace" (film for which I have a strange adoration), "16 candles" and "El Club de los Cinco" another of those tapes that I have special affection.As a teenager, a summer night I found this tape, needless to say that I felt almost completely in love almost instantly Molly Ringwald, my heart and my teenage mind for quite some time, apart from the rest of the cast Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, John Kapelos, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Paul Gleason. In addition to the main theme of the mythical film "Don't you forget about me." anthem of an entire generation of thirtysomethings between who I am.Among these 5 characters, on the other hand, it's easy to feel identified with one, the athlete, the ready but clumsy, the criminal, the Princess or the crazy idealistic, translating between them a simple group where this stuck almost the entire population. In addition to the argument, which goes from less (some boys in a school), to more during the hour and a half of footage, a tape that could perfectly represented in a theatre, go to be theatre to the more not being able to some Spanish theatrical producer have not thought about adaptation? Or even in the musical? jajajajaResumiendo: an excellent classic eighties that is worth remembering.</body>
