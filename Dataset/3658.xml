	<body>Lily is a geek and Jarrod another even greater geek. She works in an ersatz currísimo McDonalds and its highest aspiration is to take orders to Jarrod going to eat on a daily basis to your store that he works in a nearby electronics business. When Lily is dismissed from his job decides that geeks are born to be United and begin a relationship in a peculiar fancy dress ball.I feel dislike pure and hard towards this kind of grotesque comedy boring and without grace. I encentro not a glimpse of brilliance in their dialogues and its protagonists, sorry but it is that I can not help it, they are so ugly and strange to they did me want to leave the room everytime they did a close-up. This "thing" made in New Zealand has managed to terrify me so much in fact I think that it will happen to be the worst thriller of 2007-8 on my list of clunkers unbearable.As I have seen some dare to call the great Indie film &hellip; Ochentenos, revolutionize them and say that the indie film does not have that catch failed geeks and bore us with his life, in fact notice to all the fan of the absurd comedy because its poster (at least the Irish) can lead to error and obnubilar to have you inside the room from where it is already harder to flee. Isn't Indie film, is a species of short lengthened with a crappy Bill nauseam and nothing to offer on the other side of the balance. With these thoughts here while I try to take off my eyes or inflate to painkillers to overcome this tape.</body>
