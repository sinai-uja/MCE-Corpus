	<body>Directed by Michel Hazanavicius and starring Jean Dujardin, Bérénice Bejo, Aure Atika, Philippe Lefebvre, Constantin Alexandrov, Said Amadis, Laurent Bateau and François Damiens, this weekend comes to our charts almost in total anonymity OSS 117: El Cairo, nest of spies.Based on characters created by Jean Bruce, the film puts us in Cairo from 1955, a real nest of spies. Everyone mistrusts everyone, all plot against everybody: English, French, Soviets, the family of the deposed King Farouk, who wants to return to the throne, the Eagles of Cheops, a religious sect that wants to take power. The President of the French Republic, René Coty, sends his master weapon to put this crazy House in order at the edge of chaos: Hubert Bonisseur of Bath, called OSS 117.Lo true is that in my life I had heard of the novels of Jean Bruce, but one is surprised to discover that the first of these was published four years before the appearance of James Bondbecoming a bestseller at the time with a total of 265 novels behind him.Curiously, director Michel Hazanavicius decided to take this archetype of secret agent virile, seductive and somewhat misogynist, something normal for the time but completely outdated today day, and transform it into a caricature of itself, so the character is approaching more to other nefarious secret agents such as smart, Mortadelo y Filemón or even Austin Powers than the beloved 007. But, unlike the parade of freaks supposed, to cite the example more recent, the second incursion of the characters of Ibáñez in the celluloid, the dander of OSS 117: El Cairo, nest of spies has some charm, basically by its elaborate production design and certain refinement in his humor.Certainly in the gala film are inevitable supposedly funny gags that start just smiles minds protozoicas or more Associates relatives of the writers, but generally his sense of humour interspersed cafre with refined in a very successful way, thanks largely to an excellent Jean Dujardin, who with their constant grimaceshis misogyny, his total ignorance of the other cultures and their absolute lack of intuition derides the stereotype of secret agent to the absolute limits.On the other hand, and as I said something above, both the production design and its great soundtrack will transport us to the Decade of the 1960s and 1970s, in which James Bond dominated in the twilight of the spies, capturing quite rightly that atmosphere kitsch and retro believe.In summary, a fun movie (although not a wonder) that he does not hesitate to take its context to launch certain critical lapidatorias both to the East as, above all, to the current West.</body>
