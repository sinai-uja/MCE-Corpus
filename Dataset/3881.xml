	<body>Not everything will be brainy, emotional, dramatic and bombastic film &hellip; well, okay, usually because it is not. I admit that my child spirit leads me very often by the outrageous and bonachona adventure or most bizarre terror. So true to my universe, this weekend has fallen one of Disney's old ones, of the juvenile and also that I had not seen. Arrepachingados on the couch we have got ourselves into the body "Basil, the Beverly Hills COP mouse".They were other times. Normally, one film less than the factory of dreams like this, had come out directly to the DVD market, with much less careful, a sonrojante script and treatment probably devised by Lords of suit and tie that had already forgotten how it is that of dream. But back in 1986, when the adventures of Basil of Baker Street detective came to light, everything was much easier to Disney.Su hegemony was unquestionable and there was still some artist or writer with enthusiasm by doing things right. Things would not take to change and the brightest brains of the House would end up migrating to new companies, but all that was to come.For this occasion, Ron Clements, writer and director of "The Little Mermaid" or the great "Aladdin" (one of my favorite long), adapting the child novel by Paul Galdone, which relates the adventures of a mouse who lives just below the famous English detective Sherlock Holmes, living a parallel life species.It will be a ratoncilla who has lost his father, kidnapped by a vile bat with pata de palo. So, aided by doctor Dawson, a surgeon just arrived in the city, you will find the shrewd Basil, which will end up teaming up. But the bat is not the mastermind of the abduction of the mouse, it is hidden behind the evil Professor Ratigan, archenemy of Basil, with a sinister plan to govern all the mice of Inglaterra.Como said at the beginning, other times, without such puritanical correction, where good dibus smoking pipe (sacrilege!) were, the bad is loaded characters unceremoniously (double sacrilege!) and the role of a movie was no more than entertain, without obvious moralizing, what this film get completely in the style of an episode of "DuckTales". Once to disconnect the critical eye and enjoy simple and straightforward adventure.It is obviously not comparable to the big blockbusters of Disney but much better than some by-products appearing in theaters today and which equate to the kids at the intellectual level of an earthworm, see "espantatiburones" or the infumable "Ratonpolis", I got no end of see.So, Disney weekend that did not end here. Our limit for good feelings and excess sugar is unfathomable and just Sunday desiring to make our good deed of the month or placing us in the Castores.En youth the next criticism, more adventures pseudo-animadas of good feelings. Can you resist it?</body>
