	<body>Persepolis (Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, 2007) is a friendly denunciation of the injustices that the Iranian regime infringed (and violates) its population for decades. I write friendly complaint because the complaint is articulated around the vital evolution of the protagonist, a young girl that buy cassettes of Iron Maiden on the black market, and by the grateful touches of humor with which softens the tremendous social reality of Iran. maybe the topical life history of the protagonist (first love, first disappointment, music, sex, drugs) lighten up the Iranian plight (Amen to forget this in his Austrian chapter) but I miss more than black humor and not so nice topic. Personally also scale me the little (if not non-existent) involvement active of the protagonist against oppression, he splatters but not wet. Seems to me more a pequeñoburguesa vision of a reality than an actively denunciatorio pamphlet, although this opinion do me not detract from the merits of the film and its virtues.Formally the film is a marvel of a delightful animation, stands out for its creative visual transitions between scenes, its internal pace and inventiveness in abundance, as well as those episodes which take up Asian classical art forms to tell us didactically past events. I do not know the original comics of Marjane Satrapi but the film adaptation is recommended and enjoyable. Ideal for school passes.</body>
