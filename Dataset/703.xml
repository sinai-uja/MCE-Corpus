	<body>When the taste for classic and contemporary are associated in perfect harmony a director of the likes of Scorsese surprises us with a film that, first and foremost, entertains us because it has the necessary elements for this: an interesting history, organized narrative structure, a good dose of action, a few actors that convince us, a perfect use of time (both)(, that a film of two hours and a half is not heavy) and, as a final auction also boasts an excellent soundtrack.If anyone still doubt the acting ability of Leonardo DiCaprio (something that does not understand that he was unbeatable in do's Eating Gilbert Grape), possibly after seeing this fantastic story begins to give him a vote of confidence. Although, if know it a little they worry not because an intelligent and irreverent bad, of those who love, interpreted by a ripe Jack Nicholson and a beloved COP noble and elegant in the hands of Martin Sheen.A Scorsese are also likes the classic crime film and therefore is welcome because in that film he cares and pampers all the characters (up to the most despicable), and that makes that the film will not be orphaned of intelligence and feelings, that Yes, wetting it and pointing the finger it is not common sense in a group (that one thing is that the villain is not idiot and quite another, that it is a blessed).Unlike other films of the genre more explicitly detailing the organized world of the mafia (something that has already done the same director in Gangs of New York, 2002) in infiltrators, the narration exceed more than information, although it contains some winks that will take us back to the harsh reality for a few seconds.Without doubt, a great production, characteristic of an industry that understands the film as entertainment which must also be profitable (something that Europe does not always happen).</body>
