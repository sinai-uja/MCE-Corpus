	<body>Film lover show starring Kevin Costner, Ashton Kutcher and the usual secondary television lately in all the films, Neal McDonough, the argument baby plenty of films of the genre, and is easy to recognize in it part of "Top Gun", parts of "Officer and gentleman", and even things that remind us "Vigilantes from the beach", the "beaten" films are attractiveat the same time dramatically predictable in some moments of the same.Both Costner and Kutcher are correct, both in its aspect of teacher and student gifted, although I'm starting to sick of this kind of late in the Filmography of Costner, and it is to be the hero and the martyr begins to be commonplace in the Filmography of the author of "The bodyguard".I imagine that Andrew Davis (synonym of entertainment cinema), has made the film as a tribute to the coast guard and its divers, deserving of course; but cut and paste sections of other films, even at the risk of not always entertain is; mention apart from a dark picture where at times you have to guess rather than see what is displayed on screen.Last, and by no means least important, it did not want to end without highlighting the Trevor Rabin classic score more broadly speaking, where accompanying the film with a sound reminiscent of the epic film, manages at times to give the film a higher entity what it deserves.In short, film to eat popcorn and little else.</body>
