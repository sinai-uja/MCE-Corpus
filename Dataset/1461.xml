	<summary>Salvador is a tape that without a doubt will remove consciences.</summary>
	<body>Perhaps, I would describe this film like those, not you can "revisit", similar to "Requiem for a dream" this is one of those movies that sense, bad body and the scourge feel your stomach will accompany you during a very long season in your consciousness, go, as my father used is one of those movies that "leaves sediment".To start with this start, plagued some moments that are part of the collective memory of many already, we peinamos gray, or we lose hair, accompanied by the excellent soundtrack of Lluis Llach.Tal time, one of the drawbacks that I put to film is that it is spoken mostly in Catalan, and that even if you drive a little (as it is my case)you finish need subtitles to understand it, that the viewer disturbs him slightly, so as the stupid Mania accompany the scenes of action with loud music.I've hallucinated by the ease with which Daniel Br√ºhl speak both Catalan, Castilian, go that it seems that the boy takes life living in Spain on the other hand, I wanted to highlight the excellent photography, where sometimes the black and white becomes part of the screen and where only emphasizes the blood (red) if it appears in color.Last, and by no means least important, excellent actors, although perhaps highlight Celso Burogallo, without saying a single word in the footage, we see the face and the stomach twists you altogether, giving the credibility and the necessary complexity to the role of the father of the protagonist.In short, a tape that without a doubt will remove consciences.</body>
