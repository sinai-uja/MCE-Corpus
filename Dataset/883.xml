	<body>Preceded by a monstrous campaign and only one week after its official premiere in United States, reach the Spanish screens a multimillion-dollar production whose main objective is to restore and revitalize the decadent careers of its director Tony Scott and its main protagonist, Denzel Washington. But as the talent, fortunately, there is no money to fill, has resulted in a full of absurd mediocrity and at times bordering ridicule. And it is that after a promising beginning, the film will deflate and slowing down until be tired. For those who do not know, déjà vu is a French expression that describes the feeling of having an experience before something new; i.e., experience the feeling that what is already happening at any given moment happened. And this is exactly what happens to a detective and what applies to their inquiries. Playing with a theme that American society is hipersensibilizada, as it is terrorism, this film has difficult framing because it is halfway between science fiction, drama, thriller, suspense and the peripatetic comedy. Tony Scott seems that it has lost the few film foundations had and Denzel Wasghington has forgotten that a day was an actor. It is possible that it is a box office success, and promotion expenditures have been brutal, but this will only be enough for the producers, do not see beyond the so-called vile metal. A new disappointment of Hollywood; and they are a few this year. To forget.</body>
