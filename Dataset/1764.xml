	<summary>The film adheres well partly warlike but laugh in the diplomatic or politics. The "300", a technical feat, a shame of pro-American movie.</summary>
	<body>This film has two very different analysis. From the point of view visual, effects, image processing, of technical quality, ability to engage the Viewer? And another, terrible, political fanaticism and its implementation in the service of the American Empire because, my friends, United States does not seem at all to the Greece of of the 6th century b.c. Nor the film resembles in nothing to the original, which was on which was based the Comic.Grecia defended an invasion of Persian, in clear inferiority, with a multitude of doubts in its strategy, with a time where there were no countries, but City-States.The film adheres well partly warlike but laugh in the diplomatic or policy, we are not in antiquity or the middle ages, or if you want to in the centuries 17TH or 18th, where the art was used by the Church and the power to manipulate his subjects. Please! Why destroy what could have been a great movie?</body>
