	<body>This afternoon I have been the last production of the marriage finally well agreed between Diney and the famous company of Pixar animation. The boy fish ate the great. And I liked, perhaps because it has entered a field so far not used to Pixar as he was more mature than previous productions audiences. It is curious that another King of animation, DreamWorks, with successes led to a not so child audience (the Prince of Egypt, Antz, Shrek...) has played in my view in his last movie, neighbors invaders, precisely to the sin of child.I have read poor reviews, as the of Theophilus, that missing humour, more action, and see the moralina for the kids too hard. I however am tired of Visual coasters, why have enjoyed Cars, because it has a central development without tumult, without laps of Bell, with settled characters who know how to convey morals curiously seen also in neighbors invaders: the importance of the friendship of the family; only here through the nostalgia of a better time spent (in the form of people abandoned by the construction of a motorway) which we should rescue while the protagonist rescues himself of his hubris, learning to work as a team.But first let me down, and yes it is true that isn't precisely a hilarious film of half smile I flip√© with each song, the passages of road and the beautiful technical invoice, as well as with some moments of the end, with enough emotion to go to taste of cinema.It isn't at the height of previous works of the company, such as the Toy Story, monsters, Inc. and the Incredibles, but it is worthwhile to enjoy it on the big screen, though one creates this type of movies is to do it at home with the nephews.</body>
