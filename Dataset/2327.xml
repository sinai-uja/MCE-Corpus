	<body>A couple of master sequences, an excellent technical invoice and a few actresses on their site, not save to a suspense film. The film adaptation of the best-selling?Memoirs of a geisha? He is victim of a mediocre direction and a script with more holes than a Gruyère cheese. Its excessive length and its claims to great movie make the projection becomes slow and heavy, especially in large part from the beginning and from the half. Does rob Marshall leaves in evidence the excellent?Chicago? He went of chiripa, fruit of his remarkable talent with music, something that demonstrates perfectly in two or three scenes of the film which holds this critical.Sigh to think about what you could have done Steven Spielberg if instead of producing it had directed (that was on the verge) this literary adaptation of the novel by Arthur Golden. And even if they had left the project in the hands of a director, Japanese and Japanese cast. Eeeen fin, a pity?</body>
