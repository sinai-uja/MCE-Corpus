	<summary>Sincere, enjoyable and very well shot to remember their first film forays Allen.</summary>
	<body>Woody Allen back roaring with a comedy where both Scarlett (his new Muse), as director himself give luster to a sincere, enjoyable and very well shot film that reminds the Allen of his first and most heartfelt film forays, perhaps, discordant note is that of Hugh Jackman, little credible in its action and is the shadow of Wolverine and the X-Men"is a slab that not even Wolverinewith its incredible metal blades you can pass through.Music again, comes to be a great companion of trip of the footage that Allen composed on the screen, and, it's a choice very well done that one accompanies, almost baton mode the image with the tune.The argument, although improbable, is fun, and you have parties where it has no very clear that you will find at the following time (Nothing predictable script of the genius of NY). Anyway, was waiting as water may and the truth is that, in my wise opinion, the opinion may not be more favourable.</body>
