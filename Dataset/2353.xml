	<summary>The film which saw the consecration of Ava Gardner and Burt Lancaster, as well as one of the peaks of film noir. Little more can ask for.</summary>
	<body>It is not the first time that I write a few lines on a film of those that fall in the so-called black film, who so brilliantly understood the fantastic Fritz Lang, undisputed master of the genre. Outlaws is headed by a monster of the screen, Robert Siodmak, makes a display of narrative resources, games with cameras, the handling of changes in level and the combination of drama and action in this film.The presence of two colossi, although by then not so recognized, as Burt Lancaster and Ava Gardner beautiful, help provide greater packaging a story already in itself is interesting and that manages to convey the sensations at each time experienced performers, which combine the anger, satisfaction, frustration, love, fear.The dense atmospheres, the contrasts in the characterizations and undeniable nostalgia that awaken some of its scenes make outlaws a film in which other elements such as music, M.Rozsa, are essential in the full Assembly of one of the works of film noir in general, and by Siodmak summits, in particular.The history of the gangster and Pimp, with a fatal woman is one of the recurring arguments of the genus, and undoubtedly one of those offered by larger game. And more if the script is based on a short story by Hemingway. For this reason, we can say that outlaws is a great movie; not a masterpiece, because it fails to do so. But it is a good movie.</body>
