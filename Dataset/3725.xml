	<summary>The tape passes from mere entertainment for a rainy afternoon on DVD, these tapes where one cannot lift are several times of the sofa, which reenganchar to it, will have lost thread or rope, or you bother losing 10 or 20 min.</summary>
	<body>Among my circle of friends, where I have a couple of friends gays and lesbians, me strange basante nobody I speak of this movie, as if they did "Puppy" "Red roses" or "The trouble of Gray", however "Chuecatown" as if her would have swallowed the Earth, that is to say much of the type of tape that we face right?Today, after the new incursion of the Christmas with Will Smith and his "I am Legend" premieres not I really wanted break my head and wanted a comedieta of rapid consumption not I give much to think, or to attend, and the election could not be more accurate, since this film combines not only all possible gay topics (more than the bear type) but that seems above shot most of the possible homofobiassomeone even heterosexual can see and feel sadly angry.Juan Flahn, in the direction, after many shorts, made his debut in this, his second feature, with a script where it shows the shadow of Felix Sabroso and Dunia Ayaso and is that that "quirky" film made in Madrid, can only leave the head of two of them, but with a stick, while in "Descogelate" one started laughing with vivid situations byPepón Nieto, here, the two protagonists characters seem to very desubicados in the District of curious Chueca.Es as the characters of Pepón Nieto and Carlos Fuentes interpreted into two "Geeks" or "Geeks" (insurance so understands better) gay, lovers of comics, science fiction film, and jealous of their relationship, with more normal and without any caution in the neighborhood of Chueca Madridan excellent place of Madrid where can walk with total and absolute tranquility, not with that fear of "cool." which seems that it branded this stupid comedieta.On the other hand, note that Concha Velasco is on the decline, and that, after her excellent role in "Welcome home" of David Trueba, here plays a role for which he does not seem to be made, that fretful mother of one of the protagonists, also join to Rosa Maria Sarda, a major Spanish, another stupid paper film and add to Eduard Soto (an actor that I like frankly) but here seems to be repeating many clichés that we have seen him walk after the television show "Buenafuente".Tape not happens mere entertainment for a rainy afternoon on DVD, these tapes where one can get up several times of the sofa, both to go to the toilet, as for entering the kitchen for French fries, which to reenganchar at the same not be lost thread, or warps, or you bother losing 10 or 20 min. the same, if the Cinema Act obliges us to "swallow us" things like this, bad we are.</body>
