	<summary>Love the youth drug. Cassavetes could not hide certain sympathy by these errant and the sticks are for parents. It shows them as protectors or as desapegados. Parents who have never seen an chapter of SOS adolescents.</summary>
	<body>Nick Cassavetes returns the address, after the empalagosa the diary of Noa with Alpha Dog, a history of independent air based on a real event, which starred Jesse James Hollywood, a juvenile which in the film is called with a name no less film: Johnny Truelove.La film shows us a group of young Californian of more insane in their vices that are so poor who do not have more than money. A bad day they decide to kidnap the little brother of a type which owes them a few thousand dollars and what was a game of urba thugs becomes a sudden entry into the events pages.Cassavetes could not hide certain sympathy by these errant and the sticks are for parents. It shows them as protectors or as desapegados. Parents who have never seen an chapter of SOS adolescents and interpret Bruce Willis and Sharon Stone. The worst thing about the film is the spirit of docudrama about interviews with family members that Cassavetes wanted to increase the drama and give credibility to the story, but on the basis of the story is already itself a drama and that is based on a real event, are over.Do and if something more than enough you is undoubtedly the? mucus interview? that stars Sharon Stone engordada by grace of the make-up artists appearing with a radical change which rather seems the blonde relative of the Eddie Murphy Klump family and more laugh what a shame.The brat pack is superb and even Justin Timberlake. The boy is credible and looks multitatuaje and what is best, not sing.</body>
