	<body>One of the first films of the emblematic director cannot be clearly almost the worst but at the same time more fun. It is shabby-salchichera copy of superman has the worst special effects ever seen, the worst picture and a lower score that a success of chenoa. Among the interpreters that they walk in a ridiculous general highlights CAMERON MITCHELL "Night of TERROR, six women to the murderer" and FRANK BRAÑA "Present in all films of the director". Is it is one of the largest ever shot frika and to see it has to be completely hanging or with very low mental attributes. One of these films to spend one afternoon of beer and colleagues better, for else better refrain. 5.</body>
