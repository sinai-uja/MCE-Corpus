	<body>Without knowing yet if we are seeing a movie or a game dramatized, Silent Hill not convinces or viewers of film of life or to usual game consoles that want to see on the big screen hot flushes exisenciales of its heroine, lost in a village of ghosts in search of a daughter. Neither sinks as it would like its narrative discourse in the romantic traditions of tale to the Propp. He wasted the dramatic texture of the characters, coming out here and beyond with virtually nothing to contribute to the argument. The aesthetic expensive videoclip mtv abused in two hours and little of apotheosis of superficiality. I prefer the sublime fog covers Silent Hill. Who go to the cinema to find pure gore, will discover a languid hybrid whose structure is dispersed, when not, empty. The protagonist is a woman, the director commentary, gave one greater than its mission credibility, that is, find the lost daughter. Scratching these sentimental fringes, hurry the constructivist vision of cheap melodrama rather than give packaging to the product, so trivialize, makes for a sad height. We were not to watch movies, said a friend. Time could have better wasted at home, taking videos, the grapes of wrath, by John Ford. Tonight I I'm going to put and again enjoy another vision of the deep America, so trite, but this time with infinite tenderness and art, thus, in uppercase. Blessed is the cinema which has jewelry to relieve the soul.</body>
