	<body>I have not described to the incredible but true story of little Red Riding Hood as a bad film, because it is not. The characters are beautifully designed, are entertaining and it even has some moments able to emerge, the less, an outline of smile on the face of the majority. The dubbing are fun and that they cannot help compare and checking Schreck backup for any animated film in which animals appear, let me remind you that the Brothers Grimm published the story of Red Riding Hood and the Wolf in the first quarter of the nineteenth century, which seems to me that is something before the Nice green monster out of the laboratories of the Pixar Animation Studios. But what they want to tell you, maybe it's because I'm too sentimental, but I don't like that a tale of the all the life reinventen it changing all, or almost, the characteristics of the characters, so rooted in tens of generations that we have grown up listening to the voice of our relatives. And that's why I do dislike to see the name of little Red Riding Hood in the title of a film that ends up being suspected, along with his grandmother and the Wolf of a robbery, and investigated by the police. Even without a story to which it can be called pedagogical being the original, this version snatches the innocence to the story. Anyway, I do not want to break excessively from the object of these lines, which is none other than the value the artistic quality of the film, independent of any moral or ethical considerations... And in that aspect, as I said at the beginning, the incredible but true story of little Red Riding Hood, is not bad.</body>
