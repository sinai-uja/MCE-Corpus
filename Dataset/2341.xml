	<summary>More of the same with another role; that if there will be 2 more tapes and a spin-off of the cat.</summary>
	<body>Once I entered cinema almost dragging the feet, promising myself that, in case of not like me nothing what I was going to watch endure with sovereign masochism until the end of the projection, no complain, no make aspamientos, and without cursing or to Dreamworks to make this Green Giant machine of making $$$.And yet!I enjoyed it as a dwarf! And it is that this third installment of the adventures of Shrek, follows the line of the previous, is true, and I apologize if I repeat, one can not go to see this kind of films seeking a minimum of sense or transcendental seriously, because we have a comedy that parodies the fairy tales of lifeIs there something more fantastic than that on the face of the Earth?We must thank to tape a good dowry of comedy, and like gets, without too much drama that we can break us laughing in some tragic moments of the life of Shrek, and it is that for a server death of Bambi, or of the father in "The Lion King" Simba (the latter being already quite more talludito), managed to have some "resentment" towards Disneyby torturing us with tran dramatic events.Since then, Shrek is worthless without their usual, side from Fiona, until the cat (now that I have a minimal, I have enjoyed more than the presence of famous feline on screen), not forgetting me ass, and the Prince charming; that Yes, seems a little "led by the hairs" that add pirates and Galleons as who does not want the thing on screen do perhaps a strategy to amass more pa$ ta drawing the pull of the Pirates movies?Something I said to leave the cinema with my companion (my wife, as usual) is how much they have improved in animation from the first film (dated 2001) and that digital animation refers to one year to another we see big advances in the visual field, and but that is to say Pixar, which has become his "Ratatouille" become one of the most eagerly awaited (and envidiadas) films of the year summary 2007.En accounts, I don't want to stretch me more than you need, a tape that is worth going to see with some prejudices and so, surprise, since if you expect surprise few (if not none) you'll find more of the same wrapped with another role; that if there will be 2 more tapes and a spin-off of the cat.</body>
