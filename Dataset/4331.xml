	<summary>Abrams returns to playing our chord to another amazing event, which you never know as we are going to react.</summary>
	<body>This is the typical film that generated much confusion to viewers, as they come into the room with the idea that it is a film of fear. And it is not the case. Master Abrams wanted to touch the subject of our fears and insecurities, but does not have guidelines that make up a horror film. But that presents us with an everyday situation that suddenly turns into chaos, and we do not know how to react. During the story, manages to keep a constant tension of what is happening and anguish of as the protagonists will come out of this situation.Because, from the outset, surprises the marketing campaign for the film, because nobody really knew it was what I was going to leave you frightened both, and at first they manage to forget that monstrosity and you goals in the central story that you are counted, a kind of macguffin, then surprise you with the true story, when you least expect.It is interesting to use the camera in hand in plan documentary to give greater sense of realism to this collective hysteria, but arrived some time, then I will understand more than anyone, which carry glasses, that camera in hand, it hurts the eyes and many times could not even look or had to be blinking much time to go with the movie.In general, it is a good movie to see something original in what it refers to an approach to film with special effects and a harrowing story, without highlight interpretations because what matters is the end result of all this conglomerate, which without a doubt, for those who they do not stick boats with scares, spend it well, but for the sufferers like mepick you a good match that grab you or get you many popcorn in his mouth, to not scream much.</body>
