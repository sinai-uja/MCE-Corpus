	<summary>The weather man pretends to be the portrait of the life of a poor unfortunate fails nothing will goes well. And although it stays close to do this, you cannot move.</summary>
	<body>The weather man is based on a good idea, but it stays halfway, Nicolas Cage and Michael Caine's performances are very good, but it is not enough to bring up a movie that could have been much better.More striking is the soundtrack, with music by composer Hans Zimmer that does not fit and, at some times comes to bother quite as being too repetitive and neutral, also stresses much because it is used quite the appeal of cut dry the soundtrack when it begins a dialogue, which in another context would be very good, but here just not curdle.The moments of humor are the best of the film, and counteract the drama of the life of the protagonist, that everything will goes wrong.The typical humorous scene in which a character or two leave sitting with the lost look too abused, is an effect quite funny, but if abused it starts to seem redundant, but the face of Nicolas Cage and Michael Caine is priceless.The stories of the children of the protagonist are a bit stuck with shoehorn in the film, especially that of the son with the Counselor (which is also totally predictable), do not advance film and in some moments it seems that the plot has stopped and it won't anywhere.The weather man pretends to be the portrait of the life of a poor unfortunate fails nothing will goes well. And although it stays close to do this, you cannot move.</body>
