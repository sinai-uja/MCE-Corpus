	<body>Since then, more and more, and especially after seeing "Memento", my appreciation for Christopher Nolan to grown. From "Batman Begins" to pass it to enjoy pipa with "The trick ending".Then I bought "Memento" y. good, a true wonder.Let's start with the direction of Nolan. Simply brilliant. From the first moment to the last, Nolan boasts a genius that accompanies us throughout the film until the surprising end.The script is work and grace of his brother and the same Christopher. The script is great "guilty" that the movie is what it is. And it is the best of the film is the way in which it is told. Backwards. Therefore, you know the end, but do not know the principle. It is very morbid, as the third episode of Star Wars.En the actors, all dressed up some very credible papers and look incredibly. From Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss up Joe Pantoliano.Lo best of the tape is the montage, a wonderful montage full of intelligence that will delight the Viewer.A true genius, a real class on how to make good movies. One marvels, a film that deserves to be remembered. Ve√°nla, has no waste.</body>
