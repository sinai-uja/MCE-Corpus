	<body>I have read that Kubrick had a modern soundtrack composed for his Space Odyssey. Then he thought and chose what we know, with classical music. He got was a futuristic feeling of classic work. Sofia Coppola has done the reverse. He carefully recreates the France of Louis XVI, but music is today. New Order, Air, The Strokes get closer to the essentials, what was the protagonist. Coppola did not want to talk about a dead Queen long, but a living woman.The Austrian heir her married the Dauphin of France at age 15. His greatest drama was that, initially, it could not have children; the King had problems in bed. As I read, frenillo, according to the film, an incomprehensible stupidity. If not given an heir to the French, the role of the protagonist in the Court stumbles. His relationship with the lover of his father-in-law, King Louis XV, Madame Du Barry, is contempt; the rest of the courtly life nor the wonder. The blood and the abolengos spread with morbid thoroughness honors serving things that she prefers to do alone. In the absence of marital life, the young Austrian surrenders to the game, luxury, fashion, wigs, jewelry, and pastries. Tradition speaks of Marie Antoinette as the pitiless Queen who lives with its back to the suffering of its people, Sofia Copola escarba in the human being behind the legend.One comprises the person. But a film is not as easy to fill. The heroine dramas do not give to much film. The tension over whether the King consumará or not to end his marriage did not to fill the film. I like the end, this farewell. but not at the price of endure all the time that comes forward.</body>
