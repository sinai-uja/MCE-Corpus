	<body>The beginning of The Nanny Diaries (diary of a nanny) is great, absolutely fun. Disney x-ray about high society in Brooklyn, with an irony that is rare in this type of product. But since that (quite rightly) Johansson meets Mrs. X (a Laura Linney sublime), things are going for the worse, although without losing miserably the pace. So one of those brilliant comedies could have been a lot better, that make you think. But unfortunately this is only found in its main section, and else turns out to be correct, but not exactly brilliant comedy. In addition to its beginning, highlights a pretty dedicated cast (along with Linney, Giamatti outboard short appearances) and some gags stuck with some grace. The rest is an accumulation of clichés and a love affair of the most incredible (in the literal sense of the word). The end is approaching the typical romantic comedy with tears (of any character, not the Viewer) included. Yes, it will look like all frightfully tracing any comedieta, but I can assure you that to see, for example, in family, is not at all bad. Laugh, enjoy a bold brunette Johansson, forget a dash more absurd than anything else and lose it at the memory once end credits. Nothing out of this world.</body>
