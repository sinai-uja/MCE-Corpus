	<body>Mother who streaked with the number 23 of the balls. Do you know that to Julio Cesar put you 23 stab wounds? That cruelty, Hey. Insurance had mania, by to give so many can not say that it is a suicide, even that was unintentionally. Well, and now when I thought that we have 23 pairs of chromosomes, hair like hooks I made. And you will say, what has taken the Tito to say these things? Nothing, my children, nothing other than usual, clear. What happened was that I spent the entire film looking for the number 23 on all sides. That obsession more foolish.The film is about a type that becomes obsessed with the number 23. OLE, so then you say that do not synthesize.If we quitásemos the film obsession that can generate in the Viewer by the number 23, would certainly be quite flojota. But has a very suitable ritmillo to evade you think things that add up to 23, or failing that 32. Another example, my pseudonym to write is "Ramiro grasses Povedilla" coincidentally totaling 23 letters. In two days I tatúo 23 in the front, good, no, to see if gets me some on the chepa screaming "To Plaza Castilla". Well, the film is very curious to see, but only by the anecdote of the 23. If it weren't for this, it would be boring, given that the obsession of protagonist fails to understand at all. And that to two stories in parallel I tide.In short, ten fingers, ten toes toes, more cock and balls added 23. Rare is that do not reference this figure in the film. It is worth to see it, although you do not have big expectations.In addition I'm going against my medium Zucchini, who said that shit go. Today I sleep on the couch.kisses.</body>
