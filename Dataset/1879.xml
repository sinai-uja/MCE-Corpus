	<body>Joel Schumacher is passed to the psychological and supernatural thriller the number 23, a film of promising and interesting argument that the limitations of its director and cast have become a vulgar movie. Starting with a bright and dazzling start to generate illusions, the weary and slow pace are going imposed as it progresses the footage, which coupled with the attempt to cover too many areas without focusing on any of them, end up causing some boredom and boredom.In the end, one has the feeling of being before a comic with several different morals and philosophical pretensions, instead of before a good tape of terror, which is what really expected of it. The fact that its main protagonist is one of the largest histriones of history, which has never had very clear the difference between Act and do the jerk, does not help. And it is that the face of Jim Carrey is associated with strange gestures and grimaces, but hardly with dread or fear, despite their repeated attempts to seem a dramatic actor of truth and thus achieve two of its main goals, that long since they are earning the respect of the Academy that they reward him with an Oscar and be considered a true actor. Possibly the first of the two you get one day. However, in this film is noted with clarity that the main problem is a bad direction of actors, a very poor development of the script and an exaggerated search for timely shock rather than terror. To take a NAP in the film, or have an original coasters when it is released on DVD, it could serve. On the other hand, if what you want is to spend a good afternoon or night of suspense, in any case arise throw money at the entrance.</body>
