	<body>Working trash won't be to the (ass, ass, ass) annals of film history, but made me laugh to see that geeks are everywhere. In addition to the evolution of computing, which seem to having the film less than 100 million years. Retaking of geeks, from where come these types that scary but anyone throws? They entered the building overnight, killed one and sat on your site? I think that more than one happens not a psycho, but they are, hence giving the key. See if the normal are them and I I am not more than meat of psychiatric hospital.The film is about a type that works in a boring Office, in which the Chief putea le to limits by all known. Total, that the boy in the middle of a therapy psychiatric stays mesmerized and his life changes. Decides that life is to be happy and gets the world by montera. Happens to go to work, is it linked to the waitress who liked him amounting in the Corral, the world upside down that they say.Tad rare if it is, but can be seen. On the one hand, elected characters have their dotted, in particular who was dismissed 5 years ago but are still paying you for a bureaucratic error. Of those in my company there is more than one, that the day be lifted will be the revolt of geeks and laugh you comecerebros zombie. The argument continues more or less easily, but if they wanted to make a comedy is could have left behind some scenes that amuerman a lot. Oh, and when ceases to be hypnotized? By the way, the neighbor mola.In short, film about a type who hates his job and when you want to lose it is promoted and hipervalorada. Nice Comedieta, but little else.Can be seen, but without large risotadas.kisses.</body>
