	<summary>It is a pity that this foreign Garrulos Vs CC with an inconclusive end, where it does not delve into the motivations of others.</summary>
	<body>Koldo Serra (famous for his short film "The Witch's train") performs here his directorial debut in feature film, with this film, set in the year 1978, in a rural setting, at least be to congratulate on his debut, many others fail (or arriving) to that.A thriller that drinks from many sources, (everyone cites "Straw dogs" and "Deliverance") so the argument and the history is not only overly theatrical, very predictable in some cuts of the same.I quite liked the change of plane, in many of the images where the camera with a lens change moves from a character to another, be a bullshit, but my I liked.On the other hand, lately underway fashion include some well-known actors in films "made in spain" so make the sale to other countries easier and more bearable for the tape, one of the problems with which the Spanish film for distribution.It is a pity, that this Garrulos Aliens Vs CC with a final unfinished, which do not get to delve into the motivations of others, and where we have so little information about the motivations of the characters, one has them invent and Imagine getting something clear of it.</body>
