	<summary>It is just the same as always, trying to update it, but without achieving this, bored to seeking surprises, entertains that does not seek more than that.</summary>
	<body>Tape single action, without looking for him more than 3 feet to the cat and that repeats in a thousand situations already known previously, come on, that if instead of to Wahlberg, we put Chuck Norris, Stallone or even Schwarzenegger would have more or less the same as we have seen on the screen.Antoine Fuqua ("Training Day" excellent and mediocre in "Arthurian") get here capture with an astounding similarity an infinity of moments of the action genre, coming one even "smell you" everything what is true in this Mix-generic action, pity of a director that he saw immense and now begins to remind me the latest John Singleton, another started beautifully and now directs clunkers as the 2nd delivery "To any gas", but as well a friend of mine says "managers are also human beings who pay the mortgage to make ends meet".It is true that the start of the tape is great, and that more than one would like to put in the hands of one of the snipers appear on screen (soldiers envidiados by any amateur Shooters) and the plot Government is designed well, but the tape passes boredom to be more predictable that one can imaginewithout never surprise the Viewer, seeking some moments in some salt and pepper.Mark Wahlberg, Michael Pe√±a, Danny Glover, Kate Mara and Elias Koteas compose the choral Division, Wahlberg with his stick face, Crag with his role of latino committed to the cause, which begins to be his label of the House and his own cross, vase Glover light years of Robert Murtaug in the series "Lethal weapon", Kate Mara as a woman where I have seen to this "jamona" before? and Elias Koteas that I remember as a secondary shift in hundreds of films.Anyway, that as I have repeated a thousand times, it is nothing more than the same always, trying to update it, but without achieving this, bored to seeking surprises, entertains that does not seek more than that.</body>
