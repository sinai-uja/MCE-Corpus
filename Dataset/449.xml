	<body>My newly acquired "Lizenz" dvd premiere Summit of Spanish of late 1970s comedy. Mariano Ozores directs with firm pulse what is perhaps the best comedy of the unforgettable (and unique) couple Esteso/Pajares in a whirlwind descacharrante, which just fail their last fifteen minutes because he totally loses the pace and does not show a climax or something like.Anyway, yesterday I descojoné as if it were the first time I watched it, with these clever phrases (especially of Pajares) and gestures (Esteso before you play your first bingo) and I'm missing to Antonio Ozores, very little role for such a great comedian.Editing is wonderful, with a clean master, current interviews and audiocomentarios I've tried and they seem fun.I guess that SazMann not soon leave me a recadito on my alleged "cinephiles", but I say with our heads held high collection DVD of these cracks was something that many were calling for a lot of years.Mythical phrases of the film:Traenos a few skewers of something fun. Frenzy! Row, scratch that! And my favorite, the Pajares says when Ozores leaves no win anyone in the bingo: but as we are going to win anything with this shark 2 hence that swallows everything!!!!Lol, her writing and I descojono. Torrent should learn that sometimes, the secret lies in the simplicity. (As it did in the first part) I wanted to see her and even man Omega, who came to see the last half hour descojonó on his couch. 8.</body>
