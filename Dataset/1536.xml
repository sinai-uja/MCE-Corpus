	<body>Spanish film from time to time puts us in the mouth a few drops of honey, out of the hand of "torrents" and "Mortadelos" are great films like this that brings us, a story told to pieces, piece by piece, as in an imaginary puzzle, where a staff of familiar faces, the always excellent Celso Burogallo and Carmelo Gómez, Mariano Alameda and Cesareo Estevanez televisionnext to the beautiful newcomer Judith Diakhate, they compose a tape that although your argument is misleading (the horror announce seems a film "Monster") and not a tape of coincidences abound where things "normal" as the envy and the hatred in the villages, well know some of La Mancha, land of my mother's family.Something that caught my attention is that a Spanish film, is not "made in Spain" If you don't have your ration of sex or light clothing women, this is not an exception; (damage made to the film uncover, by Jove!).Opera prima Jorge Sánchez-Cabezudo is a wide, in all its splendor film, where a few frames open almost at the same time, dan shelve, one by one without leaving a loose, and mira is difficult happen, since there is usually always a loose thread that desliar the Web.In short, a good Spanish movie, that from time to time be done patria to noses!!!</body>
