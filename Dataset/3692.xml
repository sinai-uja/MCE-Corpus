	<summary>The cat and mouse game moved to a parking area which is undoubtedly an attractive place to develop the action but the ineffectiveness of the director takes no party minimum.</summary>
	<body>A mediocre French actor which was fortunate work with notable ALEXANDRE AJA on HAUTE TENSION because apparently connected forged a friendship that convinced the Gallic director to produce him and help him on the screenplay of his first feature film.Apparently little learned the actor serving a typical PSYCHO THRILLER thousand times seen with interpretations pleasure starting with the unbearable BENTLEY WEST that seems lately pigeonholed in villains of three to the fourth for repeated the role of GOST RAIDER. The victim is the beautiful RACHEL NICHOLS view in the ALIAS series and debuted as a protagonist.The cat and mouse game moved to a parking area which is undoubtedly an attractive place to develop the action but the ineffectiveness of the director takes no party minimum.Technically if giving the size in their photo sections or the attractive sound, although a mediocre script attached to worst actors does not give to much.It can serve as entertainment if it is not very demanding.</body>
