	<summary>The film tries to get their dramatic touches, which are much more pathetic than usual, and is that Juani, dear, life is not rosy.</summary>
	<body>Personally the film has seemed a sovereign pain, since the music (trying to sell a soundtrack where are groups that do not interest me at all), or interpretations; Maybe a little Veronica Echegui, since the "Canto del loco" Dani Mart√≠n, better to be devoted to sing, so that it is acting leaves much to be desired.How beautiful is the SMS language, that that pisses off the language of Cervantes to become an unintelligible gibberish, where this girl, attached to their parents (away from teenagers of today, which ignore, Brats altogether in their most hidden ignorance).The film tries to get their dramatic touches, which are much more pathetic than usual, and is that Juani, dear, life is not rosy.In short, I imagine that this film will end up selling alongside "7 virgins" in an inseparable from the best film ever shot kinki pack.</body>
