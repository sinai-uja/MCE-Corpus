	<summary>Film of Fritz Lang who feels some of the principles of Film Noir.</summary>
	<body>A Professor (Edward g. Robinson) comes in contact with the attractive model (Joan Bennett) in a table that is displayed after a stained glass window. From that moment, gets carried away by the taste of the forbidden and ends in the Department of the young, being involved in a murder when you must defend against the attack of a furious lover (Arthur Loft) and its subsequent investigation, carried out by a shrewd district attorney who is a friend of the protagonist (Raymond Massey). The appearance of a hamp√≥n (Dan Duryea) that it's blackmail the women, complicating the picture, and the protagonist must be thinking as a man of science, cold and methodical, resolution of the incident without affecting his reputation and his family. The plot is complicated, as if it were a nightmare, and both protagonists are forced to trust one another to save his own skin. While going up the thermometer of intrigue, an exceptional collection of tasty dialogues, moments of tension and situations that will then be common in film-noir also is compiling. Above (or below) of this plot strongly subject to the conventions of the genre, one can sense an attempt to combine elements of psychoanalysis and give a meaning to the relationships between the characters. The resolution of the film, with a not very appreciated in its time resource, perhaps to operate as a "happy ending", but also gives the opportunity to add an interesting new dimension to the plot. As if all this were little, Robinson and Bennett's performances are impeccable, like lighting, photography and most of the side, which ultimately leaves us one of the best films of Fritz Lang in his American stage.</body>
