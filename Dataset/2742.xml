	<body>He was eager to see this movie. Kevin Costner has been very great and his version of Robin Hood is excellent, as his Eliot Ness and his Garrison in John His co-stars here are Willam Hurt, it seems that from A history of violence is always the same role and Demi Moore. What happens is that here the three roles could be invested and nothing would happen, would not mind who is the poli, the villain or "the other".In Mr. Brooks Costner is a schizophrenic addicted to the murder, but that isn't a spoiler because the first 90 seconds of film make it clear.At times it seems basic instinct and at times any Demi Moore movie, but does not stop working despite the (hedging) police plot and because the surprise factor is zero. Impeccable invoice, is the classic movie for cuarentonas couples come to the cinema in mass and "alucinen" with what it does Kevin Costner, will like as liked another movie for the public: American beauty.I don't know if you will be pleased to marriage which put his son Kevin Costner in Jesús.
