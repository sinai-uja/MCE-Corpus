	<summary>I certainly expected it exceeds at least the first part, it exceeds go if it fares worse because it is still worse, more boring, less defined characters, catastrophic interpretations, without any sense fights filmed rhythm of video clip.</summary>
	<body>I think I'm a bit masochistic because not to lack a Lynx to appear that this single film could be a pestiño.We all know that both ALIEN and PREDATOR separately were two myths of fantasy at the time giving two films as notable as filled with action and terror.Over time some luminaries came face to mythical monsters to attract fans to the battle, the first attempt to balance with a resounding success in the mediocre but at least fun FREDDY VS JASON, was obviously born in this way a new form of storm the box office, so do not miss another confrontation with the ALIENS and PREDATORS being resolved their differences in one of the largest ever shot nonsense which resulted above boring.In an attempt to take advantage of the goose that lays the golden eggs is responsible for the sequel to the STREUSE brothers specialists in special effects in numerous blockbusters such as the X-MEN saga or 300. surrounding himself with a young cast very little known where they emphasize JHON ORTIZ makes double on the Bulletin Board with its intervention in AMERICAN GANGSTER and STEVEN I triumphed in the television series RESCUEME. I certainly expected it exceeds at least the first part, it exceeds go if it fares worse because it is still worse, more boring, less defined characters, catastrophic interpretations, without any sense fights filmed rhythm of video clip.Only thing notable are its special effects for that invested almost the entire budget. Of course the script is again absent.</body>
