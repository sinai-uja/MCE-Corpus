	<body>The current cinema, similar to the big studios tend to produce only films which in theory are a sure attraction for the box office, awards or critical, also are increasingly more willing eager filmmakers to make films transgressors, innovative or at least that are out of the ordinary. Taking advantage of this situation, there are also many pedantic directors who made films looking for strange thing for free.Jesús Mora belongs to the Group of eager filmmakers, and Villa Tranquila is his new work, a fictional story that seems more a documentary for the way in which it is shot, and above all, because the majority of actors appearing in it are interpreted themselves. At a glance, anyone might think that Villa Tranquila is a species of Buenos Aires version of city of God. However, Jesus Mora portrays this neighborhood on the outskirts of Buenos Aires with dignity and at no time looking for crime, poverty or drugs hype. The story is told with a pace slow, excessively in its first third, but this does not diminish its main virtue, realism and the positive and optimistic look that conveys.Quiet Villa is a fictional film which seems to a documentary, and although this scared many, is a fresh and different, which is addressed to that audience restless, Avid intelligent stories and tired of the artifice that lives the current film.</body>
