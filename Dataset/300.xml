	<body>You can already imagine what must be to celebrate a night of new year on Board of a luxurious ocean liner. Because these are the Poseidon passengers when a tidal wave sweeps the boat and puts it, literally, legs (or keel) up. The few who do survive, decide in principle follow the advice of the captain expected ransom, but later join Jofn Dylan, who has begun a solitary quest in pursuit of survival through the mass of iron in which the ship has been converted. Directed by Wolfgang Petersen (Troy, the perfect storm) and starring a broad cast among which are (not for artistic quality but for screen time) Josh Lucas (road to glory, an unfinished life) and Kurt Russell (Sky High, Vanilla Sky), Poseidón is one of these new versions (prefer this definition to the bombastic anglicism remake) fashionable now in Hollywood and that basically consists of take a movie of thirty years ago and then back towithout contributing anything new, and even a little distorted the original. "The Poseidon Adventure", in 1972 headed by Ronald Neame and interpreted the always excellent Gene Hackman, this version is much poorer in the development of the script and in the Assembly of characters, empty most of them and barely worked. Undeniable is that Yes, the wealth and quality of special effects, the only raison d ' être of the film.It is fair to acknowledge the intensity and spectacular nature of some scenes, accompanied by a good soundtrack which adds to the sensations that it transmit the film. If we stay with the moments of fast-paced action, Poseidón is a film which could be described as even enjoyable. That Yes, if we value the whole, is nothing more than another "transatlantic" pufo.</body>
