	<body>Marie Antoinette is really sexy. It may not be historically correct, but this is the version of Sofia Coppola. It is a feast for the senses. The soundtrack hits the tone, ironically set filming at Versailles, which is spectacular. It achieves a trance of false authenticity. What has perhaps never been but somehow we can imagine. The exuberance, the costumes, the cakes.This film is a kind of trance that absorbs you. It seduces more than convinced. At the same time you closer and you away from the real and the imagined. It only lets you listen from afar what counts in the corridors. Phrases loose in an indirect narration which is more atmosphere than shoes and lace. It allows between see this Court that isolated of the world and at the same time privacy does not exist even in the bedroom.Navigate between commitment and pleasure. It is an experience in which you could soak up. Lyrical without being a sentimentalist. Lush if exaggerated. Tasty for my palate.</body>
