	<body>It is a sentencing phrase that I loved nothing more to hear it: the tastes are like ass, everyone has one.And it is that I used to refer to a genre that excites me and to which I cannot give an explanation of why and is the musical. Simply because I let spread by the energy given off and me magnetized by very tontorrona as it may seem.In the middle of a critical message against racist prejudices that had at that time, we have a movie that sandwiched the most many-colored songs along with a sixties who falls in love with and look that dazzles to what is happening in every scene.Away from the histrionic could be the image of a characterized John Travolta of women, we have a sensitive interpretation, allowing that while your're acknowledging the Zucco Danny of Grease, really fun with the image being the mother of the protagonist in the film, complemented by a great Christopher Walken.Aunque already know my devotion to the Pfeiffer and in this film is not for lessfew actresses are provided to interpret the characters evil with so much grace and naturalness as she makes it and also aderazada with this sensuality that characterizes it, much to overdo it.It is a film which we must not ask del olmo pears, simply excited the music lovers and is trying to do with the smile of the poor that should accompany that likes this kind of movies.I have also had the opportunity to have fun with Os declare husband and husband, whose surprise is having fun and make me laugh in such a way, without all the jokes in the trailer have been spent. A good comedy for escape from the real world and drop that laugh camouflaged during our usual life.And another side, Angelina Jolie, shows one of his best performances in an untamed heart, we notice that the actress much fought for that role and that he had in his conscience that the own Marianne Pearl, the real protagonist of what happens in the film, he chose it to her to interpret it.It is a film that reaches the heart reminded me of the feeling I had when I left the cinema to see United 93, because you know that these things happen in the world, but see them recreated and masterfully told in a film, you are still surprising though you know as they occur.Soon, get me internet at home with which I can update the habitually that I like and as a final Coda, on a day when I can not be locutando because we do not have emission where I'm working, is that I have been granted the mortgage of my flat, which I'm happy because I arruinar√© for 40 years, but having a sofa and a dvd to watch my movies.</body>
