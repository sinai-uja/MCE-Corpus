	<body>The Camino de los Ingleses summer some young boys in the Malaga of the 1970s, focusing on a player you just be operated and in the hospital has known a man that has marked so he decides to become a poet, obsessed with the Divine Comedy of Dante.La second film directed by Antonio Banderas is one of those films that you love or hate, which is done with a tone that can get tired enough, if not maintained an open attitude to her, that poetry pervades every moment of this film and each image giving rise to a set of images between dreamy and poetic that they can be very beautiful but also something exhausting. Note that this film is a very personal project of Antonio Banderas and why is an experiment carried out with the freedom of someone who has nothing to lose. Most of the actors are known for his work in television, as Fran Perea, that here makes the best role of her career, because so far it had not known for being a good interpreter, and comparing the work done in 13 roses with this it shows a great difference, perhaps Antonio Banderas was able to get his best performance, or perhaps a good actor who has not had the opportunity to prove it. It will have to wait to find out.</body>
