	<body>Marching (Waiting! 2005, Rob McKittrick) is a pleasant surprise unpretentious even tries to, it seems, to become Clerks. Because here are governed by the vulgar joke (well, with Clerks, but this is more americanada) and that, friends, I like. It is rather more fun than expected, and above all, rather more cerda.Ryan Reinolds continues too rubbing his tick, but now he has behind him a great group of Misfit professionals who give the best of themselves, especially that cachondísimo (in all aspects) Luis Guzmán, that, as I said "serious criticism", it is the only thing that is worth of a movie where everything else is zafiedad. But if the most uncouth of the movie he is!I know from experience that much of critics that cover these productions they write them without seeing them. The criticism in the country or in your cool Guide On Madrid demonstrate this. Brrr, me hot. The case is that if you want to be ninety minutes with a smile on his face and not complicate your much the evening the movie it comes but that very well. A 7.PD: Anna Faris, I love you.</body>
