	<body>Because you want to tell you, my Dead Silence has given me fear. Just remember that Donnie Wahlberg was a sex Idol of young women in the 1990s with New kids On The Block and his brother (Mark Wahlberg was a gift no one model of underwear and was called Marky Mark) and see how they spoil the bodies is sufficient reason to shout the scare.Once passed the child trauma and the death of the myth erotic must say that what comes to be the same film in itself is a tremendous boring and predictable firecracker without a single new scene. A ventriloquist doll appears at the door of a young couple (should be denounced by copying to the Gabbo of the Simpsons television) and clear in less than two minutes there is a murder which carried our protagonist to her hometown to discover a terrible curse recalled anecdotally as a simple fairy tale. From the moment in which pisa first Ravens Fair. Aesthetics, the direction and even treatment of the film seems removed from an episode of supernatural (that Yes, without the two brothers solid floating around the scene) and as such with 40 minutejos we could have vented this tape with more grace and sense of humor.That Yes, now it gives me panic Jose Luis Moreno.</body>
