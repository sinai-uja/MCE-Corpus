	<summary>This film is a recital of cakes, mamporros, yoyas, tundas, Campion, sopapos and soplamocos in the style of "everyone", in which a fatality seems unlikely and where there are no marrow nor the poly trauma Encephalic injuries.</summary>
	<body>Two colleagues, wandering stateless people racing competitors, earning a mini-valid in a competition, with such bad luck, no time to enjoy it, disappearing calcined at the hands of a few mobsters of three to the fourth attempting to intimidate a few peddlers to gain your business. What the gangsters do not know is that our two protagonists, played by insurmountable Bud Spencer and Terence Hill, are genuine scholars in the brainy art of dispensing indiscriminate call and think to beat copper with the underworld in order to recover his precious mini-valid, that Yes, red, that "if we did not,".Simpleton plot and linear, sympathetic and sometimes inocentón, development for this film originally titled "Altrimenti ci arrabbiamo". This film is a recital of cakes, mamporros, yoyas, tundas, Campion, sopapos and soplamocos in the style of "everyone", in which a fatality seems unlikely and where there are no marrow nor the poly trauma Encephalic injuries.1974 Film directed by Marcello Fondato, "and if we did not" (title as classical as stupid in his translation), is a type of extinct film icon: "Hostias comedies", simpatico-delirious music, handsome actors, co protagonist ugly but good-natured, beautiful girl, causes fair and bad bad. Is true that this is a film listed as child, to which we will add the custom visual to the hard - core sadistic of the public of this fledgling century, make the current Viewer, more beyond the frykandéliko-nostálico, can feel disappointed after viewing. Moreover, I this receto it with beers to tuti plen. Drisfrutela and drink in moderation.</body>
