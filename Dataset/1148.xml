	<body>Were it not for Kirsten Dunst (adorable until the delirium) me or bother to do this criticism. He hoped to find myself with something absolutely offender, because I have high hopes for the small Coppolina, as shrewd and intuitive not only to conduct but to interpret. But apart from the wonderful costumes, (outstanding) art direction and photography in the hands of Lance Acord (Lost in traslation and soon "Wild in the Streets"), what is the film, it is not that it is slow, it is that he is sleepy. The cast is great, in fact the direction of actors is another thing to highlight. I think that there was another actor better than Jason Schwartzman (we saw in Spun and we will see in 2008 for "The Fantastic Mr. Fox") to recreate the face of asshole that had the Dolphin King.And higher most of this movie is that he has the cool, the splendid, the incomparable, the Sexy, unique, the regio: David Bowie siiiiiiii stay tuned by David interprets to Nikola Tesla, oddly you enough, this man who is my platonic love since my use of reason has over 130 films to his credit.Although somewhat (read BSO) the strong bet movie, fails to surprise us and leaving us with an open mouth is by yawning may lead us.I expected something more heartbreaking end, that in fact the Dauphin and the Dauphine of France, were beheaded at the guillotine, I do not understand why this is not shown in the film. Ending a romantic and family escape in the Royal carriage. Perhaps Sofia wanted to stay with the nice part of the story?I believe that the broadcast media of the film is not in tune with what then is shown, "Sex", "Alcohol", we are on God? have them Hayles but at a level very subtle I would say.</body>
