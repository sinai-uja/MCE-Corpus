	<body>Well, the truth is that with this I entretuve much, and I must say that I was not the only one. Had much cattle to try a history with Celtic characters, such as Elves, I love all those things from a very early age.But back to what interests our young critic, remained mesmerized by the screen in one of the longest films has seen. Usually just something tired towards the end, and usually end up in the arms of any of us, but this time it did not.The adventures published by Arthur, in the company of a Princess Selenia, too loaded of sensuality for a young audience of only 4 years, which does not understand even of contoneos, maintains in a fun and entertaining tension between funny characters Elvish and hair-raising struggles.Without a doubt, a good way to pass the time, and to understand that children are also capable of great achievements with effort, tenacity and courage. And that our small critic, suggested to record the video at the end of the film, to see no less than 1000 times, her I calificaré of excellent.</body>
