	<body>I saw her pass in the channel four original Disney Channel High School Musical production, a phenomenon that has stuck strong well with teenagers from all over the world and, above all, in States Unidos.El movie has broken all records since its original transmission on January 20. With its multiple reruns on the Disney Channel has already garnered an audience of 30 million American viewers, while the soundtrack reached the top of the Top 10 Hits. Deserves a special mention his six nominations at the Academy Awards on television, the Emmy (best cast of actors, best choreography, best direction, Best Original Soundtrack, outstanding children's programming), which was made with two (choreography and outstanding children's programming).Cemented in (some of) the plot basis for Grease or Dinty Dancing, High School Musical is a production dedicated in particular to the youth audience (although there is also an apt√≠simo product for the whole family) that is predictable and topical to say enough is enough, but is quite fun, very nice and very entertaining. It does nothing or deceive anyone. It is sincere and contains a positive plot full of values of the family films of earlier, correct interpretations, catchy songs everywhere and much youthful energy. Highly recommended though not advised see it if one is very biased with this kind of movies.</body>
