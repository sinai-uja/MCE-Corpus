	<body>Great documentary, brilliantly (in line with the already commented on Robert Evans), on one of the milestones in the history of the cinema: Deep Throat (deep throat).This documentary shows this porn movie as a turning point for a revolution or a sexual rebellion and as a complaint about the constant danger that hangs over the freedom of expression (though I think that it would be more correct to speak of freedom to dry).Porn, as he relates this movie, is the platform for many filmmakers to get fast money and get some kind of experience. And many are in the current cinematography as Barry Sonnenfeld or Wes Craven, which comes in this documentary "confessing" to having more than one film X.Sin however this documentary serves to raise many interesting aspects and all related all morals: not only openly advocates freedom of doing porn (bringing this film on several occasions and so naive as martyr and hero of the crusade), but about freedom to see it.Obviously demonize these "film preferences" is ridiculous and only favors to the rest of humanity feel curious and him a vote of confidence, especially when it is something new.However tells, with more modesty, half-hearted and less enthusiasm the negative entailed a revolution: mobsters who benefited from the situation, opportunists who do not hesitate to support this movement to then become radical and reactionary (in this case the feminists, the worst macho there) and the enthronement of normal people like popular Heroes of the cause and the sheet to then forget them as soon as elected.This documentary even look with nostalgia the first days of porn against industry that exists now. It also comes to question the moral change or how morality could interfere with other freedoms. And is a criticism (for a change) to American morality, as drops, currently the same laws antiobscenidad of the Nixon.Sin era embargo no longer curious that most criticisms against the USA comes from them themselves (also are best known), an act of freedom itself that some practice just when it suits them, as well as here.It is priceless to see this documentary Arthur Sommer discussions with his wife, Terry, marriage which led at the time that project the movie and a film. As many other theaters that earned lots of money with that film, both received threats from the mafia for not giving them a tithe of their benefits.And for lovers of the technical and so that they see that any means is valid to do a job depending on its nature, this documentary was filmed in format Mpeg IMX.But the question to discuss it emerges me having seen this documentary is: be free is watch porn or watch porn?</body>
