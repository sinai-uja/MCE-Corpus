	<body>It is difficult to write about the most famous family of the planet without be carried away by feelings minted during the 20 years of its existence. While many think that it is stupid to go to the cinema to see something that can be seen on TV, it is not less certain that there are more who support the release of this film entirely necessary for the animation world and that certainly it worth seeing.All those who were concerned by the new voice of Homer in his voice to the Spanish, I have to give them a plamadita of relief on the back because the voice in cinema it not worthy at all nor has nothing to miss the previous.With the exception of the first words of Maggie, the film adds nothing new, in fact could be one chapter of TV, that if it is never others enjoy on-screen great something we like. The movie doesn't disappoint, I think it is very unbecoming and manages to make us laugh a lot.I want to highlight the "Spider Pig" time, which for me is one of the best of the movie, in fact if you stay to see the closing credits (is where you can see Maggie speak) look at the song of closure is that of Spider-man but Tuneada and coroso them say "Spider Pig, Spider Pig" XD, very good if Mr.No mistake, the real movie prota, it is the silly piggy.What seems to me a very intelligent move is how they have used the characters and the typical gags to make subliminal marketing on "that is worth going to the cinema to see something q can see on TV" (example: the q tells Homer to the beginning or the little signs announcing the programming of the Fox), it could be despicable, but they can afford it.</body>
