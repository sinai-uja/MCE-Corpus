	<body>Since the sun rises, fancy. The title is certainly encouraging, but more for a film of Pajares and Esteso than a film of 2006. And of course, if it is not full of aunts in pelotas, as it seems the subject loses enough. I have to admit that I have not seen whole, given that at the time I decided to search the deuvedeteca another animated, that there is nothing worse than a film of humor you embarrassment.The film is about a young lad of an Asturian people who sent to the city to make a man with his uncle. This is a local nude male, and certainly don't agree the shipping do you. But his next woman (Loles León), who wants the boy to stay. And I, is that I removed to the desire to make the summary.Let's see, Gabino Diego has been with Torrente 2 Cuco, and does the same gestures than yesteryear. Arturo Fernandez, although leave with cocks drawn in the chest, still sobreimitándose to become a parody of itself. Loles León I do not like anything good, and always has that role of dominant woman bitter life that sends much and that I can't stand. Then I get the trupé of gigolos, nothing less than the "hard" companions, "hard" UPA Dance (the son of the witch Lola), one Tuesday and thirteen, and two more. And adorning some other Spanish actor of these comedy don't finish to finish. With these actors, what we want to leave? Caca.Resimiendo, absurd film about a kid in the deep Asturias emigrated to the capital to become a man. The argument is infumable, and the cast of actors not only burden over a project that should have died before birth.Since the start you want to remove it.kisses.</body>
