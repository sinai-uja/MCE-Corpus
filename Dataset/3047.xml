	<body>Well, contestant is a movie that should have seen the film and I've rented in the videoclú, we're going to do.Debut in the length of Rodrigo Cortés reminds me, by the elegant invoice in the city without limits. The head wheel brave, fearless and with an actor in State of grace hiperactivísimo that eats the screen.Cortés returns at times that the video gave him goes hand in hand in a couple of moments (the horse) but visually is so powerful and has a screenplay so perfectly assembled in those images (again, powerful) that "you her comes with potatoes" surpassing those delusions of grandeur initials that can put the viewer in against him.The effects can make you think the Fincher pre-Zodiac and that, when we are talking about a Spanish director must be good balls.</body>
