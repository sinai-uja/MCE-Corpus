	<summary>A really violent history</summary>
	<body>A story violent, 2005, is really violent. Never better put a title. Please, be them not happen go with under 10 years old nephews because they leave them for psychiatric therapy about five years at least. Death and sex explicit, close up. But apart from violent is slow. So slow that in many parts it is suffocating. I.e. the film causes stress, because between that nothing happens or they spend the most cruel things in a moment to another.I went to see it with too many expectations, because it was marketed as one of the best releases of the year, strong candidate for Golden Globe, etc. But nothing to do. The actions of the majority of the cast are inocentonas and little professionals. Bad casting. The actions of the protagonist, Viggo Mortensen (the Lord of the rings, 2001-2003) it is good, like the of tours actors Ed Harris (the hours, 2002) and William Hurt (Artificial Intelligence, 2001). But the rest of the cast?</body>
