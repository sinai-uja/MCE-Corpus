	<summary>A well structured work, a good photography and a setting of high level. Magnificent.</summary>
	<body>Edward Norton has always seemed an enigmatic individual itself. A mysterious air that often favors their interpretations has background in any of their records. If as in this case, the role that plays is a magnificent magician who triumphs by the early twentieth century Europe, that quality to which I have referred help that his interpretation is more convincing. Paul Giamatti continues to demonstrate that it is an extremely versatile actor, while Jessica Biel continues in the line of recent years to diversify characters to not stay framed in blood and action films. The fact that the screenwriter and the director are the same person help that the argument is well linked and that the sensation of the Viewer is that of being before a well-structured work; added to this number of qualities a good photograph and a setting of high level (the Vienna Imperial mandates already alone), the result is a superb quality product.The mixture of intrigue, suspense and love the viewer require a degree of significant attention, something that is not difficult to pay because the movie itself is responsible for catching us and their little less than two hours is not that they are bearable, is that in some cases, just knowing a little. We have a film that as it progresses, it becomes more interesting, more enveloping and that Neil Burger, despite his limited career as a director has been able to give the touch of solemnity that requires the historical moment of its development, without losing the ability to do a fun job that is attractive to all kinds of publicby the multiple turns of the argument and its diversity of scenarios, which make it a multidisciplinary film. Magnificent.</body>
