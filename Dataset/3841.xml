	<summary>If you have a great story with a brilliant trio, the result obviously can only be more than satisfactory.</summary>
	<body>My fear before seeing this film is that expectations that fared before her, watch me were in vain and it wasn't as good as I thought. That fear dissipated when nothing more to appear the first scene, so shocking that it predicts the power of magnetizing and evocative force that keeps you in suspense throughout the film.In American Gangster, we see not only the work of a man who manages to impose on the world of the mafia, surpassing classic bosses that not apean throne, but unlike the majority of the films on mafia have been made, looking carefully both sides of this conflict, which pursues the mafioso and of the own mafioso, but with a much more detailed view and involving the Viewer from the first frame.Espectular the two interpretations, with Denzel Washington very convincing since the first moment and a Russell Crowe that eats the screen and in the scenes in which are the two together at the end, is a masterpiece of interpretation as long ago I had not seen.American Gangster is a new twist to the vision that we normally this type of movies, something that is appreciated and more if you can enjoy all that you offer, without having to resort to the blood cheap nor to the stories of always.</body>
