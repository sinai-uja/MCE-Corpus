	<summary>Unfortunately money has failed to create a good guided</summary>
	<body>Wolfgang Petersen dares with a remake, even though he says that only has been the initial idea of the 1972 film "the Poseidon Adventure". There is no doubt that one of the main attractions of this proposal are its special effects, and there is no doubt that with the same budgets, has been creating something exceptional. Unfortunately money has failed to create a good script, because although starts in attractive and force (five minutes already has impacted the tidal wave) hereinafter miss many things missing. But let's go little by little. In this concise home, Wolfgang has shortened the past of each character, getting to know as they are and of which foot limps each, which it makes them somewhat typical characters with several strokes.I have to say that I feel fondness by Kurt Russell (as has starred in several of my favorite films) and mandated role performs perfectly in this new adventure. Next to it we find Josh Lucas, Richard Dreyfuss and Emmy Rossum among the best-known, making some fairly normalitos interpretations, that the script does not give for more. There is a scene that recalls, well is calcada, to blockbuster Michael Bay Armageddon, but we are not going to gutting her.It should be a reference to the design of production and filming suffered, which recreate the bowels of the ship and shoot under such conditions is not easy, and although we are here to criticize and comment, we must not forget how difficult is to make believable situations and more if they are as difficult as these. Ultimately "Poseid√≥n" is a good movie to spend the afternoon seized to the armchair, not suitable for claustrophobic and makes that we let us take on the adventures of this small group, which we are debating between life and death, during one hour and forty minutes.</body>
