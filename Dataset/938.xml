	<summary>Funny, tender and sometimes devastating with the American way of life. It is worth going to see her to have a good time.</summary>
	<body>Every year there are some small movie, little, unpretentious and budget with little-known faces that makes a hole in the tastes of the public and critics and has even stuck in several nominations for the oscars. Don't know if it will be the case (I say the oscars), but the truth is that this is a film that may be recommended, as without much enthusiasm but with security that will please everyone.The movie narrates the adventures of an American family in low hours has to take the girl to a beauty contest. This simple plot excuse serves to make us laugh during a little more than an hour and a half of the American way of life based on winners (winners) and losers (losers). All members of this peculiar family are a few losers who will have to learn to live with it and live among them. The type of family and presented satire of the average American family is parallel to which we know about Malcolm or the Simpsons TV series, only that in this movie all have aspirations of winning thwarted.The cast is great, from the father and the mother, which are the best-known (Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette, respectively), until the grandfather druggie (Alan Arkin), uncle gay (Steve Carell) and the silent brother (Paul Dano). But the incredibly excellent is the small star Abigail Breslin, who cries as I have not seen crying other child in the film.In short, a fun movie, tender and sometimes devastating with the American way of life that is worth worth going to see to have a good time.</body>
