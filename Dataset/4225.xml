	<body>"An honored miner reaches a people willing to register the good gold mine that has been found." However a huge and his young wife to cheat and steal all the gold and the paper comes where everything related to the mine. When he regains the sense is nothing. "But he retaliate little by little."Film in the West of the silent medium footage (over one hour), shot by William S. Hart, a pioneer in the film westward and real hero of the far west with honesty in the manner of those times.The main character is a good man who is forced to take action when sees that nothing is alien greed (years later this type of character resume it successfully James Stewart).This film is nothing out of this world but not bored and there are good scenes of action.Worth for several reasons, as entertainment, as a historical film in some ways, not in vain is see how actually were the people of the far west, being so much more is carried realistic than classic westerns that cemented the King genus, see William S. Hart, which paved the way for future filmmakers, both ahead and behind the screen.In this film they accompany Hart, Vola Vale, Robert McKim, and/or George Nichols.</body>
