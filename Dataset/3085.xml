	<body>Driving Lessons is an interesting proposal that just however resulting in a deflate terribly disappointing. The film is worn in a very uneven manner and ends up being equally tasteless (and sometimes boring) than the character protagonist (Rupert Grint), with a plot not ending interest or connect with the spectator. Fortunately the direction of Jeremy Brock makes Driving Lessons a minimally passable film by the hairs with a thankfully ligerita pace. Something in which notable interpretations of Laura Linney (for a change) and a huge Julie Walters (Oscar) also have a lot to say.</body>
