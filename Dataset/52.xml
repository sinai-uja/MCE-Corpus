	<body>Buff, hairs and hooks I still have after seeing the film. I can only say Viva Edward Murrow and the mother that bore! Wow, that peliculón.The film is set in the years 50 Americans, when Senator Josph McCarthy devoted his life to the famous "witch hunt", i.e. to pursue Communists for the homeland. On CBS, a presenter of a well-known television program decides that already okay so many abused by this man and welcomed by their bosses, plant you face McCarthy connect on the table (abuses). He and his team embark on an epic battle against the Senator that is easily extrapolated to any time in the history of mankind. And I am not counting more, that this must be seen.Fuck that peliculón, that exciting. For starters it is recorded in black and white, which helps you quickly get you into environment. The first minute is a little boring (lyrics) but from there, it is vibrating. You spend the entire film to suffer like a fool for the good of Murrow and his team, so the atmosphere that creates, plated. The picture is very good, with very accurate levels. And the devastating argument. Since then, a lesson of courage in an age in which the brave was them cut head. To highlight the excellent performance of the character that embodies to Murrow. Bad film and the truth is that I don't see you anything that you want to tell you.In short, a peliculón of scandal. But wins the Oscar is that scholars have no idea I (that I have seen almost all). If it would have shouted "Libeeeeertaaaaaaaad" at the end I die of éxtais.</body>
