	<summary>Stardust is a tale of fairies, stars, princesses and a happy Kingdom that will delight all ages and also is always a pleasure to see Robert de Niro, a man that takes advantage of everything he does with the spectacular Pfeiffer.</summary>
	<body>Spectacular film ideal for accompanied children (who had been in the room when I was in the cinema is thrilled and applauded all the time). The original proposal of this old English story takes form of the hand of Matthew Vaughn to which you are not known other titles of relevance. Fast-paced, fun with an inexhaustible rhythm and a few actors that are wonderful in their interpretations.Stardust is a tale of princesses, fairies, stars and a happy Kingdom that will delight all ages and also always is a pleasure to see Rober de Niro, a man that draws party everything you do together to the always spectacular Michelle Pfeiffer.Si you want to spend a fun time do not hesitate to go to see her and quedar√©is steeped in all its magic, great photography, ideal design costume and not a great movie.But as not everything is perfect, the role of "Star" do not see for Claire Daniels, which I think has a rough beauty and a montesa nose. I would have preferred a Chirsten Dunst. Claire always her are great and what it is, is a wonderful chacha of those that leave you in the mailbox your phone number that you call them to clean your home for hours, but so is the film.</body>
