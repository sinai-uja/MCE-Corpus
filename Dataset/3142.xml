	<body>In the film classic entertainment, British films of thefts and robberies are prominently on their own merits. Some of them are more favored by the comedy by the drama, becoming real jewels as gold in bars or the quintet of death. Currently, this type of film has been relegated to the background until it appeared George Clooney and his charismatic bunch of crooks.A brilliant Plan is first and foremost a divertimento directed by a filmmaker of great category and with the participation of one of the finest living actors on the planet, Michael Caine. It was quite complicated with similar ingredients, the end result was bad, and the expectations for once met. The film manages to get hooked from the beginning, and what is more worthwhile, manages to keep attention until the end. Michael Radford guide the development of a convoluted and intriguing history without artifice or free and unnecessary effect blows with strong pulse. The scent of classic film that follows the film is very suggestive, and is part of the appeal of the narration. The only that I can put the tape is its outcome, a somewhat soft end that somehow lackluster been achieved previously. Demi Moore fulfils its role, and Michael Caine returns to offer a master class of interpretation.In Un Plan Brillante, Michael Radford recovers the spirit of those English movies of thefts and robberies of the 1950s and 1960s. Recover in addition a cinema of entertainment that does not insult or despises the Viewer, a type of unpretentious film making have fun to the audience.</body>
