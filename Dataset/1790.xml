	<summary>A tape seems Pixar, but it is not, it could have been more, but it is not, and that I like, and I recommend, but will quietly, so nobody is excited too.</summary>
	<body>I have taken part of Holy week just ended to drag my family (in mass) to the film, which is that it did not see the day to go to see her, I know that the shadow of Pixar is elongated, and more in this, where one seems to sometimes watching a tape of the flexo label, perhapsone missing a more slow narrative pace and is that, at times, excessive speed and the excessive dynamism of the tape, override with his narration a tape that although it is not perfect could have been.On the other hand, dubbing, (I've heard today that it was also dropping of rigour), not annoying at all, and the story, okay, I admit that I am passionate about the futuristic film, and that some things left me absorbed not only minutes after the end of the screening, but days also. (these tubes to travel I would certainly help correct my embarrassing problem of tardiness).Of course, are facing a movie Disney and final moralina, as the characters have to be more sugary that our teeth to gnaw, although it is inevitable to feel appreciation for some of them, without going further by the friend and roommate of the protagonist, who know in that becomes then for all those who have seen the tape.Finally, a tape seems Pixar, but it is not, it could have been more, but it is not, and that I like, and I recommend, but will quietly, so nobody is excited too.</body>
