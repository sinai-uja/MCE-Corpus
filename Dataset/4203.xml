	<body>TRACE SLOBOTKIN after a long career dedicated to television scripts made his debut in the direction and the truth seeing this horror I ask it to park his career as a filmmaker.It is not that the script is quite grim, the idea of a young apprentice serial killer gave to at least make a fun horror comedy. The trouble is that the promising material is a starting point interesting deflated precipitous as flat characters and lacking in interest where boredom is not off in a TV staging, developing between the interpreters include a couple of familiar faces, the man of sand of the third part of Spider-man THOMAS HADEN CHURCH and the former child prodigy COREY FELDMAN to feature in the 1980s with lost boys or the GOONIES.None of them gives luster joining pathetic interpretations of the artistic team, all of this is outweighed by an anthological ending where the senseless covers the story that even serves for a laugh that apparently the mediocre director of truth believed that into something useful to take it seriously.</body>
