	<body>When it is the story of a character has both thrashed is frankly difficult to avoid redundancy. Hannibal is a film which was expected much and frankly has been half-hearted. Still sweet and perverse seduction of young Hannibal runs through your retinas tearing your corneas with the thirst for revenge. I can get lost in those frantic and bereaved eyes understand the origin of evil is not but the birth of a pain so abominable that it is stuck in your soul forever.I expected "Yes", I expected something more of this young Hannibal who has love me completely. But it is the character that I am talking about, not the film, confined to having "little detail" the transformation of the child into the monster. You stay with the feeling to know more, what ocruri√≥ then? where were the characters after all that?It smells far sequel, but it annoys me intensely that it is distorted and unnecessarily breakdown of a story as Hannibal Lecter. We are still to discover many things that this film does not clarify.I have to say that I have not liked neither the music nor the "reality film" pace.Caption: To my colleague Francisco Bellon I do not dicerencia has seemed very gore, he was indeed me you waiting more strong in this aspect. A greeting Fran!</body>
