	<body>They were born more than 20 years ago as a comic strip in a popular American television show. Two years later they gained independence and the animated series and the longest-lived comedy series in the history of American television was born. At this point, is it can what the Simpsons that has not been said already? After almost 400 episodes, the most extravagant family of Springfield makes the leap to the film in the midst of great excitement around the world.The Simpsons are already more than an animated series, already part of the culture of millions of people, and many are already unable to imagine a world without the Simpsons. Homer Simpson has become a real icon for several generations in the last two decades. What brings this film which will not bring the series? Nothing new, that on the other hand was to be expected. The big question was whether it would be to live up to expectations, and must say Yes. The Simpsons: The movie is full of acid and irreverent humor so characteristic of the series, and has some truly hilarious and surreal sequences. And how, always is not Homer, which with his clumsiness and stupidity will start the louder laughter of a given audience.There is no doubt that it will be one of the greatest taquillazos of 2007, and possibly of all time. From here we launched a warning to sailors, concluding credit titles bring some very juicy surprises, and it is worth waiting a few minutes in the armchair of the film.</body>
