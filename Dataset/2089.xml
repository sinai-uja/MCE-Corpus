	<summary>A worthy end to a trilogy that has resurrected a genus which was dead and buried for decades.</summary>
	<body>The adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow has been one of the more recent decades followed, and have revitalized a genus which for decades had remained in a latent state, by decision of the large studies that viewers will most unimaginable way.The first installment of this series, Pirates of the Caribbean: the curse of the Black Pearl, was so unexpected as overwhelming success. Skillfully directed by Gore Verbinski, he knew how to Captivate a wide spectrum of public, and soon became a reference for other type of similar productions. The continuation of this first film, Caribbean Pirates: dead man's chest, was able to retain, already without the factor of surprise on their side, the spirit and the spectacle of the first. And now, just a year after the second part, comes Pirates of the Caribbean: the end of the world, which closes the successful trilogy. Although it starts with a pace a little slow and hesitant, indeed soon recover the pulse of the previous two and becomes another film full of strength, vibrating and able to excite the Viewer. Johnny Depp returns to demonstrate that it has few rivals when it comes to portraying colorful characters, and outboard of the role of the cowardly and amanerado, but charming, Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom meets more than in his role, while Keira Kneightley (would be a pity if it withdraws from the film really) is impeccable in his role as class wealthy but rebel girl. Excellent photography and its already known and catchy soundtrack, complete a production that will delight fans. As a curiosity, to say that on this occasion appears Keith Richards, guitarist of the rolling stones and one of the references of Depp, in the role of father of the pirate.</body>
