	<body>Buf, that fear of poster, with all the of the roller coaster dead and with face to give scare. Wow, that bad feeling. Although if he had made any a clown nose would have been more appropriate for the film that concerns us.The film is about a group of students who finish high school (or that they have twenty or so and try to pretend that they do not reach the age of majority) and are preparing for the graduation party. Before the meeting, decide to go a sub-group to the amusement park to ride a tremendous roller coaster. When they are mounted in it, a girl has a premonition and sees that all are going to die. He rides a mess of noses and get that several of his friends fall of the Ferris wheel. Moments later, all those who fell not die to derail the trolley. From here, the death seeks tirelessly (and with lots of imagination) restitution to the audacity to snatch his cold hands to these sinful souls. You sound argument?Well, the first took his grace. The second, come, okay, we accept ship as aquatic animal. Damn, but the third is infumable. Lodges within the genus "Is laughable, is of fear or is a bullshit?", which on the other hand is a genus with great titles today. The actors are pathetic, salvandose the two coming out in balls for that than a nude always glad to view. The deaths are a laugh, which are both absurd and gimmicky (grips black is gracios√≠sima). And the argument is too linear. Furthermore, as you know that going the sheath, you wonder for anything at any time.In short, a milestone of a kilo with which you can take the afternoon with the chums at home (when it comes out on DVD) while you inflais pizzas and beers a hungover day of Sunday. Go to the cinema to see this deserves that they return it the entry.</body>
