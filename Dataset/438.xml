	<summary>Beat feísmo and dandruff to the very same Torrent in this "Super Nacho" that takes place in the world of lucha libre fighting.</summary>
	<body>After "Cars", the world of the film should have muted last a decade with regard to competitions and laurels. That should happen every time a brilliant mind shows everyone how thick that weaves. But it has not been the case, the world not only cinema has not removed the hat, but us pursued and harassed with two niceties on the world of the competition. will Ferrer looks like his Southern geniality with the framework of racing cars in "Last lap", and Jack Black surpasses feísmo and dandruff to the very same Torrent in this "Super Nacho" that takes place in the world of lucha libre fighting.I'm not saying that they are not worthy to see although I recommend experiences more cheerful, as, for example, to undergo a root canal, or most surprising, as, for example, listen to an interview with Carmen Sevilla.Jack Black will go down in the history of the cinema for having discovered that viewers always we are part of the losers (or underdogs) and want they earn when they pursue high as helping moms sick or orphaned children. The idea choice for casting a gorgeous nun complete with a touch of realism the social background of the work.</body>
