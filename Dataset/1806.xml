	<summary>In the film, it is not a tele-film... A compliment that not you could miss to "The River King". It is rather a film you are passing in cinemas in summer at a meeting to the many of the night in the most remote room of cinema.</summary>
	<body>I saw this film with a total ignorance of the argument. After seeing, I can say that it has a simple argument. Moreover, the plot goes lurching between what already have seen thousand times and the crap that the teen horror film we are accustomed. But then we came to the end, at the second and real end of the film. then the film surprising (in fact is the only time that makes it) with a finish nobody expected (although the first see the League).In the film, it is not a tele-film. A compliment that not you could miss to "The River King". It is rather a film you are passing in cinemas in summer at a meeting to the many of the night in the most remote room of cinema. It is true, the film is nothing out of this world, but is entertaining, and is not so bad. And only the end already makes that the film worthwhile.There is no any noteworthy aspect in the movie, nothing to make her be special. Except the end already commented.Advice: If you are going to rent. do not preconceived ideas, not see with illusion or enthusiasm. Then the film will be enlightening.</body>
