	<summary>New twist to the genre of psicotriller road.</summary>
	<body>New snapshot of Australian terror following the recent success of Wolf Creek and with great parallels to is although we say that the thing ranges from other horror movies road "highway to hell, Say yes".In is occasion presents us a psychopath that falls even better than their victims. A nice, polite, charismatic type played brilliantly by the protagonist of "Scott Mechlowicz" Eurotrip. The other two British youths are also very solid in the hands of Amelia Warner "Aeon Flux" and Shaun Evans "Miss Julie".A handsome actors casting, a rule of thumb in this type of production although in is time so they are mindless Brats and have greater packaging their characters.Newcomer who comes from the world of advertising Ringan Ledwidge gives a consistency to the footage getting that we are interested in the psychology of the characters without the need to give perverse scenes, the film delves more into relationships with their unequivocal in a game to three bands. This well run by landscapes high exceptional way thanks to the good work of photography, a good soundtrack, with a good narrative gives us moments of Frank entertainment keeping expectant spectators.By alas both success and why hide it good cinema is clouded in a puzzling final part where everything happens too fast, it is as if the first part of the footage was masterfully conducted but when it comes to kill everything fades. Leaving a flavor sweet and sour of what could have been a film certainly magnifico and stays only right.</body>
