She tells attempts to Gyuri Köve, interpreted by the young Marcell Nagy, a teenager of 14 years, by conjure the horror which meant to be imprisoned in the German concentration camps.FATELESS joins the latest cinema dedicated to revisit the event that marked the twentieth century. There is a need to detail, detail, hell that underwent the Jewish community in SCHINDLER list or the pianist; exercising the historical memory in Germany with the fall and SOPHIE SCHOLL (LOS ULTIMOS DIAS); a particularly poetic vision in life is beauty; the role of the Catholic Church in the ninth day.Its predecessors Koltai film retains some of the features already shown previously: a description of horror in the concentration camps. Before and after this story, destination without to discover us a critical view on the matter, this time from the position of the Jewish population at that time. It's desvictimizar, and is an attitude of submission of the Jews against nazi barbarism, based on prejudice and religious values. A brave but brief critique in their development. Too late. Too much detail. Too dazzling photography. Too much rhythm marked by innumerable fades black.What shows Koltai in much of the film already had seen him. It emphasizes it through a photograph converted in painting. The really interesting thing, the final stretch. Insufficient to understand what mean without destination.</body>
