	<body>The vaunted film of Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller, creator of the comic strip, fulfils its promises (justitas). Well, technically very well, but I was expecting more spectacular in the use of his aesthetics of black and white and some chromatic "intrusions". I do not know the comic, but all those who have read say it is nailed. And in the magazines do not stop to compare ourselves some of the vignettes with stills from the film.As well, perfect. That (the simplest mimic taking to the creator of the comic as co-director) succeed with distinction. By what I have understood, each comic contained independent stories. And that remained it in the film (3 chapters) except for certain characters that match at certain times. All are interesting and curious, deliver a lot of if and the stories could become great stories if they extended more, but have been able to give sufficient to "mini stories" as to leave us satisfied the length and pace.But precisely this subdivision of 3 chapters makes the film look as a collection of shorts with points in common. Best of the film is that it does not lack know the comic to enjoy his universe. The stories are quite sordid, violent and cruel, I imagine that as had devised them Miller. The Gallery of characters and actors marching through the film is impressive and are welcome to see faces known to participate in this project.But all the bells that have repicado excited about this film are a tad. It is a great as both Rodriguez, a point of inflection in which has not made a sequel to El Mariachi or Spy Kids, and that is to be welcomed.And by the way, the way in which his work is reflected in the initial titles is clear "shot and cut by"? generic but very descriptive?</body>
