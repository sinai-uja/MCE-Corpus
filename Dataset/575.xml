	<body>To have fun with "Snakes on a plane" should make a small effort. You have to go to the movies forgetting something between the 1970s disaster films that it has shot and now. The film does not have the credibility that asks the viewer today day, so only I can recommend to the nostalgic.I understand that bloggers took part in the decisions of the producers. I wonder if they gave him that air so delusional gore. The film begins as an episode of holidays at sea, with a parade of characters going to travel and suffer in the flight. Each one is marked with easy to remember conflict and completely cartonpiedra. Snakes are flooding the aircraft in an amount disproportionate, Carnival, sometimes almost makes you smile by the size of the nonsense you have in front of the eyes. It is the plan of a mobster who wants to kill a witness who will testify against him. It is the least. If you are still able to have fun with the airports, and forget the parody that he was made the Zucker, or with tarantulas, Piranhas and other monsters, just stop calling plausibility for an hour and half and take part in the Festival.</body>
