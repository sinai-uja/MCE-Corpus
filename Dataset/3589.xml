	<body>Zeitgeist, is the title of a controversial documentary that makes hairs are put end to a reality that nobody wants to see per that is there. It is a documentary distributed over the internet and that you can enjoy on their official website that it is subtitled in several languages.Based on a great quote from Jimi Hendrix: "When the power of love overcome the love of power, the world known peace," Zeitgeist shows three different viewpoints on religion (Church), the survival of the fittest in society and power.This documentary slaps us with a reality to open our eyes to those who still do not believe what is happening. "They must find it difficult." those who have taken authority as truth rather than truth as authority "Produced by Peter Joseph, was created non-profit to inspire people who begin to look at the world from a more critical perspective and to understand that things are not as most people believe." The information in Zeitgeist is the result of a year-long research. The period of research and the basic sources used/referred to in the same andthe Interactive Transcript includes the official site.So successful projects and recomenedables as it is I do have wanted to bring to light some documentary that I have saved and that will make that one shaking more than.After that our job is to get "how to do" or "manage" a revolution. This is the message. Reveals you, believe in you should, while you may believe in others, ye shall be yours, sed free.</body>
