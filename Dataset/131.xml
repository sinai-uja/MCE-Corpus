	<summary>Good movie with an interesting script</summary>
	<body>The Slevin case is presented as an interesting proposal in the current film scene, which has a good cast and a very appealing trailer. Unlike other productions, the trailer doesn't fool us and offers about 100 minutes of fun and entertainment. With an aftertaste to Hitchcock and his "with death on the heels" Paul McGuigan presents the avatars should suffer Josh Hartnett to be confused with another person. The interesting thing about the film is that at the beginning or herself is taken seriously, which leaves us freedom to take us with humor and watch situations which otherwise would seem unreal to us and even a little ridiculous.The casting that offers us this thriller, because we identify and sympathise with the characters, which facilitates the way to let us go by the events Jas√≥n Smilovic has written is a great success. The pace and the Assembly do the rest, and a very right way, that we are not losing in the explanations that give, or in presentations of the characters, which in others such as the recent Syriana, if it happened.We must praise the script has a few very successful and effective changes, and why not we become artificial, which also facilitates the work of the actors, as in Josh Hartnett and mildly in Bruce Willis.Sir Ben Kingsley, Morgan Freeman and Lucy Liu are the trio of ACEs that accompanies the aforementioned coupleplaying the two Mafia bosses and the neighbor of the protagonist respectively. Ultimately the case Slevin is a successful film which has an interesting script, that can make us remember the usual suspects, and will delight those fans to action cinema, with several characters, in which van giving clues, timeless resolutions, and that they admire to Tarantino, Rodriguez and Doug Liman.</body>
