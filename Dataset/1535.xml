	<body>Well, once seen only I can say that it is a very good idea, but very badly exploited, second attempt of the same roll (the first was the jar of Juliane Moore daycares in "Mysterious obsession") and yet after pulling much of the movie throwing meat in the grill let us pretty bad, and tell us the reason for the death of the husband of Jodie, nor claims and/or motivations of the bad guys, or know that it happens before, not after what we saw on screen, and is trying to shorten (just 1: 30 min. projection) a film that if had stretched a tad more, would have given quietly for two hours.Brilliant Jodie, as always, also Sean Bean (although everytime I see think instinctively of Boromir), very well Peter Sarsgaard, giving to its role as the depth that, at times, needs a soundtrack that provides just enough in the film (James Horner excellent in the composition of the musical score), and a few levels very strange on a set created especially for the occasion, the aircraft "lie" most perfect in the world.It entertains, get that time and peak (always I am complaining long which made many films and this peca short) passes almost flying (hehe) and, although it is not round, certainly manages to entertain, the penalty is that if we tried to deepen a bit, we we stay only scratching the top without reaching the bottom in fins.</body>
