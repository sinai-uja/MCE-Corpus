	<summary>Another way to see the conflict of diamonds and take care of what happens until that blessed white stone appears in our hands.</summary>
	<body>Conflict diamonds in Africa would give for several films, books, magazines and other pamphlets, a nearly negligible piedrecita generates hatreds, jealousies, and a large trail of blood (as the title suggests), would seriously consider that "A diamond is forever" and one with a heart overwhelmed by history, tries to demistify that myth, families have just been shattered (talk about the tape)guerrillas make your August liquidating right and left to the staff, and 4 exploited in turn, try to fill their pockets. Di Caprio, (lately I am catching the aftertaste to see him on screen), Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou, who I had the pleasure of discovering "In America", (even without makeup just looks excellent on screen), they form the distribution of the tape, to Di Caprio, him we see online, more than correct, Djimon Hounsou excellent, knowing to bring his character all the drama that deserves, as well as Jennifer Connelly brilliant in his appearances. The film maintains its pace from beginning to end, and at any time cease to things happen, the problem may be that open as many frames at the same time, it is difficult to close them one to one of the pull, to highlight undoubtedly sensational special effects (those explosions and flashes) and a strong and well-constructed, script although I sayso independent plot makes the film at times a tad bland. Finally, another way to see the conflict of diamonds and take care of what happens until that blessed white stone appears in our hands.</body>
