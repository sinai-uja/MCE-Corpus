	<summary>That you do not cheat, is a musical. Notepad, huid, fainting, fingid whatever before going to see this if you don't like musicals. In addition, as we always like big donkey walk or not to walk, the abominable volume can make us bleed by the ears.</summary>
	<body>I have to admit that although the film has seemed an infumable tru√±o, sing as God. Well, as God when you want to say something to voices, why go roars are girls. Also I have to admit, in Spain we don't have singers as well, or if we have them, the start shit Eclipse them (this has nothing to do, but there is).The film is about three girls of color (of rather mulato color) that they lose a contest of song promises, but earn a manager that must be launched them to stardom. For now, get to act doing the vocals of a singer of fashion, but the ambition of these three girls stays there. So a lie with one another with the same, one with the other and thus, singing and giving the subject passes the peliculilla.These things I go through watch movies without knowing what they will. It is that nothing happens for nothing all the time, rather than sing these young girls and Eddie Murphy. And it is that as they spend all the time preselection, then not you can pass nothing. The synopsis I have told until the last ten minutilla, to give it some emotion. And of course, if make English to understand the songs, perhaps we could climb on the bandwagon of the action. But as we stayed in My tailor is rich (which comes meaning my namesake the Richi) not because we learned anything.In short, that you do not cheat, is a musical. Notepad, huid, fainting, fingid whatever before going to see this if you don't like musicals. In addition, as we always like big donkey walk or not to walk, the abominable volume can make us bleed by the ears.</body>
