	<body>Before putting me in the field, say that just at the entrance of the cinema, as 2 Madrid were Ariadna Gil and David Trueba, both, buying tickets for the film, have occupied seats right in front of us, although I would gladly discuss with Trueba for a while, in the end, and although my wife has pressed me everything he could for that at least thank you for "Welcome home" (a film which we love), but I have not been able to, I can not, people "famous" impose me respect.Having said that, nor is that you amount too but looks good here, on the blog, begin to talk about the film, one of the most eagerly awaited by a server, and that, after its premiere in hundreds of festivals (and also their inordinate success) and its representation at the Oscars this year, it was time that was premiered, and is that all the news arriving from outside did presage that we were before something big; and so it is.J.A. Bayona composed a film that, drinking of indeterminate sources (most drinks it plagiarism), knows how to get into the consciousness of the viewer and it is easy to see in "The orphanage" as many references to current horror cinema that you lose the account, is true to its final also saves some similarity with a recent success of patriotic cinema. Belen Rueda (other than that stupid television presenter who was long ago), and is that someone placed, not only the cry in the sky when Amenabar you gave a role in "Mar Adentro" but, when someone said that Bayona would give in his debut leading role he wanted to still believe that I was wrong, certainly, has not been so, and now we have in Bethlehem to a large our film, with 2 movies already to be rubbing shoulders, within very little on screen with someone of the stature of Julianne Moore, there is that, that would tell others, but Bethlehem, little by little it has carved a niche in this difficult world of the 7th art.Begins the film less more giving, first an overview of things, leading gradually to a vortex where the terror, the darkest of our fears and claustrofobicas situations on-screen almost in hand, and while we breathe, and while it is true that sometimes the poetic is mixed with the real (not desvelaré more)other times is the paranormal which takes the field of narration.Excellent sound, gloomy, dark, band with a classic nuance little conventional, and led always from the hand of the images, without clash, without showing chiaroscuro, in short, a delight also debutant composer.Amazing sets, costumes, and foreign, the House where events take place almost, a character more gloomy, harrowing, almost dying.As a negative note, for putting one it is the performance of Fernando Cayo, completely painful, that not seen credible in his role as husband of Belén Rueda, more interested in any "triviality" to find his son, disappeared "in combat".In short: More terrifying (without exaggeration) in the horror film Spanish, one of those wonders who like both inside and outside our borders, if all the tapes were like these, the crisis of the Spanish film would a chimera.</body>
