	<summary>X - Men 3 destroys nothing less than the Golden Gate Bridge in a prodigy of mutant engineering who already want to sign many human architects</summary>
	<body>The third part of X-Men is summarized in the run-up to a battle. The forces of evil, led by Magneto want to destroy a drug, called "The cure", a mutant turns into a normal man. The forces of good, led by Xavier want to avoid it because the drug is only freely given to who requests it. They are right who say that this is the most superficial of the three films. It is the most superficial, but not enough.In the first part, Magneto was much more tax because I wanted to become mutant mankind. The third remains intransigent, does not respect the freedom of those who choose not to be mutants. The reason is Xavier. But not so clearly. It happens like that in a strike are right a few to sabotage the work of all? Are entitled the strikers to make pickets? The theme is thorny, why mutants change both sides. The hesitations, the comings and goings of mutants composed a long digression on individual freedom and collective responsibility. They are the preamble to a confrontation where the excitement of the film concentrates. The two armies have been defined finally: what are its strengths? The second question: who will win? always save fewer surprises.Someone should write one of those film books full of photos with a catalogue of all the monuments that has destroyed the film for the greater glory of the cultural heritage of the United States. In Spain only we could showcase to Alex de la Iglesia to sataniz√≥ medium Madrid for this badass wonder titled "The day of the beast". X - Men 3 destroys nothing less than the Golden Gate Bridge in a prodigy of mutant engineering who already want to sign many human architects.</body>
