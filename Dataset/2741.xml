	<summary>What begins as a descojones ends up coming out of mother and touching the "Landismo" but you expect, do Hamlet?</summary>
	<body>Roddy Piper is Sam Hell in this post-apocalyptic comedy in which mutants, a few frogmen not term to understand as they are called, (the copy of it looked very well, but the audio stank), are the main threat of the man.The case is that the first fifteen minutes are the comedy anthology and the close-ups of the prota are great, is a species of the snake Plissken but cowardly and gordo.Hell is the only man on Earth who has not been sterile and the main hope of humanity.Clear, women are prickly and want to grab him, but takes a shell in its parts can fly into a thousand pieces that reserved you for fertile women güays. What begins as a descojones ends up coming out of mother and touching the "Landismo" but you expect, do Hamlet?The mid-term onwards it rubs the unbearable and the laughs are forgotten. Painfully bad.</body>
