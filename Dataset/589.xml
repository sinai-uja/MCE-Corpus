	<body>At the level of the real, a captain of the army of Franco directed raids to destroy the maquis in the North of Spain. It runs the year 1944. His pregnant wife arrives at the barracks with his daughter from a previous marriage. The baby expected is his obsession. At the level of the fantasy, the daughter is guided by a fairy to the Lair of the Faun that proposes three tests to become Princess.The cruelty of the captain does not know any limit, begins as free and just being excessive. The world fantastic of the Princess and the labyrinth does not contain any be so terrifying. That is perhaps why it is less exciting.In "The time machine" by Welles the protagonist returns from the future without being able to test that it has been there. It could have been a dream, but there is a loose, it brings a flower of your trip. Matter is enough for the reader. Del Toro seems less concerned than Welles that we created in his fantastic creatures. It was probably mesmerized with his monster, this perverse Franco soldier to the core. That makes me wonder how much charm would have lost if the film had been in pure reality.</body>
