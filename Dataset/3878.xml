	<body>Again a proposal which, a priori, given us fear. As well, it does not.Based on a short story by Stephen King master, "1408" presented us to Mike Enslin (John Cusack), a horror writer who comes to all hotels that are supposedly ghosts.Bored of not come up with any, reaches Enslin a postcard on the room 1408 in the Dolphin hotel, in which many people have died. So our protagonist is presented with the intention of finding and living unexplained facts.Samuel l. Jackson makes his appearance as the mysterious hotel manager. From here, Cusack will have to face (solo) to almost all of the footage, which will attempt to resist in a room where no one holds live over one hour. Taking different references between the great films of the genre, Mikael Hafstrom, it presents a room in which begin to happen strange things. With some disturbing point, the film takes place on the path of normalcy without being nothing out of this world, and deflate slowly, until you reach a "final" with surprise, to subsequently leave us the sweetened "The End" so much like. In short, a film for lovers of John Cusack and the stories of Stephen King, which disappoint the more ambitious and the horror film enthusiasts, and that will conform to the moviegoers less demanding.</body>
