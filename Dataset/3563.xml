	<body>I usually hallucinate me always with the cinema of animation, whether it's a film of sheep, or of bees, as in this case and, although the idea, and the proposal (a little copy of the excellent "Antz" which put voice Woody Allen), is something original. That bring to trial the human.However, and after 2 or 3 good moments (all of them shown in the trailer), the tape is deflated and one becomes more exaggerated boredom (with included yawning), and so the 90 min. (too, for a film of this magnitude) they are eternal, and it is that is extra, or missing or bored, or all together.Animation this quite achieved, dubbing, not so much has that Arturo Valls, and Furthermore, the jokes stuck with shoehorn reach tire, both big and small. If to this we add that a tape of animation is not only overwhelming animation is the first "bluff" of the holiday season that ends almost almost of inagurarse.That disappointment holy God, that disappointment, waiting for more than just much less.</body>
