	<summary>One of those cases in which a series of low impact Gets a much better film than expected. Fresh air for a genus for which times of decadence.</summary>
	<body>Based on the series Firefly, of ephemeral passage through the Fox channel, reaches the Spanish charts the last film by Joss Whedon, Serenity. The director of successes such as Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel, makes the leap to the big screen with a title that shows that Whedon has few rivals in fiction today, more pending of the technique of the plot.The screenplay of is film, which incidentally has just opened the Festival of Sitges, is witty and dynamic, spiced with a few special effects used in its fair measure and characters beautifully defined and correctly interpreted by semidesconocidos actors. Perhaps say something negative, sobran some excessively bombastic speeches at times. Grosso modo, the argument tells the adventures of a former pilot of the Galactic civil war to win life with smuggling and the rental of his ship, the Serenity. At any given time, Captain Malcolm Reynolds serves a couple turns out to be fugitive of the ruling coalition (are fashion coalitions), which ends with hair-raising adventures. For those who need to find a political message, my congratulations, as I believe that in this, it was quite clear in the background of all science fiction films: If someone does persist in intervene where they have not be requested under the guise of making the world a safer, can end up causing a worse situation that he intends to correct. I do not believe that it is necessary to be more explicit. In short, a good movie for lovers of science fiction or unconditional followers of Whedon. I confess, I'm one of them.</body>
