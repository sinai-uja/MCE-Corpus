	<summary>Preceded by a propagandistic device worthy of Goebbels became one of the most disappointing taquillazos in recent years.</summary>
	<body>There is no doubt that the film version of the novel by Dan Brown is one of the most anticipated in recent times. The unprecedented success of the book, enhanced by calls for a boycott from more conservative sectors of Catholicism, no doubt led to the expectation before the imminent release of the film reached unimaginable heights. If we add to all this that the protagonist is Tom Hanks, the end result is a product whose film value dwarfs against the social significance reaches. And I say this because the code da Vinci is a film that is well set, creates a halo of mystery around its settings and characters, and at times it dazzles the Viewer, especially who has not read the book. But in general it is an excessively slow, pretty long movie (almost two and a half hours) and pay attention to which just costing work. The argument of some that say not you to know, that it is a faithful adaptation of the best-selling American author. Grosso modo, Robert Langdom reaches Paris, invited by the curator of the Louvre, which appears dead in the museum itself surrounded by enigmatic symbols and in a strange position. A from there everything was bursting and the protagonist, accompanied by the granddaughter of the slain begin an adventure that leads them to where the fantasy of Dan Brown wanted to be. I would like to stress this point because it seems that at times people forget that the code da Vinci is not a history book, which is only a novel. In short, I think that could have been a better product, and that it will be a huge success at the box office in its premiere, but that word of mouth will end up harming him. He was disappointed.</body>
