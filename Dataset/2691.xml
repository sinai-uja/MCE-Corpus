	<body>The journey of a group of workers from an English arms company to Hungary to promote the feeling of teamwork and the corporatist partnership, becomes a terrible nightmare. The proposal of starting is attractive to then get put back to half a dozen unsuspecting, stereotyped and very recognizable characters in the hands of a murderer sadico, cruel and unscrupulous, i.e. on the proposal of always. That hardly can be original to this stage and after fifteen parts of "Friday 13", many more "Halloween", sagas of "Screem" with all its imitations and after the even more recent "Saw", "Hostel", "Tourists" and company, the attempt to stand out from all of these previous ones arriving directly in the mixture of genres. "The great and also English"Shaun of the Dead"(zombie Party) mixed humor with genre zombies, in this, Christopher Smith also combines certain doses of humour with, in this case, rugged, realistic and brutal terror which is normally the case in this new trend of movies of fear that Western tourism are finally massacred with unimaginable sadism.""Severance" works. The film takes seriously the part of terror and not neglect the comic part. It's quite scary, it is very bloody, get to keep the pace and tension constantly allowing us also breathe a little and even make us drop a laugh with the already discussed gags. Proposed intelligent that manages to entertain and surprise hit as a whole.</body>
