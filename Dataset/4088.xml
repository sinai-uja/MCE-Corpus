	<body>We already have other hero carried the film, this time by newcomer Francis Lawrence, although it differs somewhat from the character of the comic, while constantine in the comics by DC Comics ("Superman" "Batman" "Wonderwoman") is rubio and London, in the film is moreno and American, in the end, it will be for the American public fit with the wanderings of this eccentric game IMPS. Addition to Revees refused to dye blond (so I can't imagine, sic).The film begins quite well, and although I have not read even a single comic "Hellblazer" environment that Devils and Angels through the streets of L.A. make the tape a film quite promising, but. It always has to be a but?As if! The ending is a bit "Insulso" those who have seen the movie know that I mean, you want to cover much in a very short time and cover all aspects of the life of "Constantine" at a single stroke (by certain Keanu to make other types of films, because at the beginning as soon as I saw him appear came me to mind Neo Matrix)(, come that this most typecast that Michael Landon in "Highway to heaven") is the best tape perhaps 420 levels made by computer, is that these demons as well-made and ends so well you. XD XDEn end, in short, which is gerund, while the film is brilliant and this solidly shot and well built the end is a tad Cansino. I expected more of the tape and I left a tad disappointed. Could it be that my tastes are changing to another type of cinema?</body>
