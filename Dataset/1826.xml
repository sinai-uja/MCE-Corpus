	<summary>The best translation to the celluloid that occurring in our bed when we close the eyes, essential and advisable but not power.</summary>
	<body>It was one of those movies that one has a kind of personal fascination, and yet does not dare to watch it by fear, prejudice and other stories, in most of the criticism I read described the film as "Martian" word that held back dry desire had of seeing her, I finally armé value and said, come and let's see if I agree with the vast majority, and started its screening, my opinion may not be more satisfactory.I had never seen a more solid and effective way to translate in images something as complicated as it is "the language of dreams", and that says a huge Gael Garcia Bernal at the beginning of the film, dreams are composed of thoughts randomly, reminiscent of the day, mixed with some memories of the past, love, passions, emotions, and all those "ions" on screen, the music heard during the day, things which we have seen and also something personal with these patterns Gondry, for the first time without Kauffman, builds us a comedy romantic (to use) where the guidelines to follow anything have to do with what we have seen previously and that mixed in a mix, displayed reality and dreams, hand in hand.It is easy to watch her and see some other dream that we suffered viewers have had ever, to accompany the French Charlotte Gainsbourg and Alain Chabat Gael which many recall as Julius Caesar in Asterix.Resumiendo movies: the best translation to the celluloid that occurring in our bed when we close the eyes, essential and advisable but not power.</body>
