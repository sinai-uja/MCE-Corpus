	<summary>Again without leaving the parameters of the accused director once again giving a masterful lesson in film sick, degrading, dirty but at the same time beautiful in their obsessions with poetry in his narration.</summary>
	<body>Unpredictable, brilliant, dazzling, imaginative or simply a genius with a camera, four hard and amateur actors out of the manga magnas works with the ease of anyone who is different or is endowed by the gene of the don to tell stories. Really exhausted me the adjectives to describe all the emotions that ANDREW PARKINSON gives me everytime he decides to bring out their enormous talent.If item ZOMBIE from a perspective totally different to the usual it addressed in his previous outstanding work, developing the phenomenon under the prism of characters that must face his disease and stop living as human beings to transform into monsters.I ZOMBIE and DEAD CREATURES merge drama with al gore taking advantage budgets almost amateurs to achieve surprise under some makeup effects, music, really excellent photography where the author did everything. Repeating with some interpreters of his previous works makes the ZOMBIE phenomenon of side to immerse themselves in a monstrous relationship that seems directly out of the head of the once terrifying DAVID CRONEMBERG.Again without leaving the parameters of the accused director once again giving a masterful lesson in film sick, degrading, dirty but at the same time beautiful in their obsessions with poetry in his narration.We complain about the lack of ideas of current terror, because while in theaters triumphs SAW 4, other European authors take wonders type NEXT DOOR or DEAD CREATURES while anyone to repair them, hopefully this film arrives one day at least in DVD because in cinemas so I do see impossible.</body>
