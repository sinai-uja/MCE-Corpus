	<summary>It is not that United 93 is bad or boring but that he expected more than one director is capable of making wonders.</summary>
	<body>"Usually happens when someone puts the very high expectations you take a downturn or it simply does not cover them, and this is what has happened to me with the new Paul Greengrass movie.""Bloody Sunday" seems brutal, of the best films that have been made in recent years. And clear, with this precedent and the poster full of criticism that put it as the best film of the year then? passes what happens. This does not mean that "United 93" is bad, or boring, only expected a server more than one director who is able to do wonders.In the script there are two differentiated parts: concerning the interior of the aircraft and which shows the chaos that occurs in other places, whether airports and control centres. And it is here where one seduces me completely and another not. The refusal is the interior of the plane, which seems more forced and less credible. Which gives you sense of film, instead the part of drivers, responsible for the army and other comrades is do you really think that you are living this live, as it was the case in "Bloody Sunday" and it is a pity because having managed to convince and keep the feeling that conveys in the above-mentioned locations, if we would be faced with the best or one of the best films of the year.However it is a great and interesting film.</body>
