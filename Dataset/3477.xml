	<body>It is incredible how the majority of children's films made the serious mistake of not valuing the intelligence of children, believing that they can accept anything without protest. The big studios have been the ears to the Wolf and many have put hands to work, producing some films that don't take stupid children, to the great delight of his parents.Enchanted: The history of Giselle aims to be a new step in the Disney factory in this regard, that at first glance it seems a parody of the typical fairy tale. The first minutes of animation do presage, and prospects seem to consolidate to go to real action. However, little by little, that intention auto - parodic is declining to go into a romantic comedy to the use. Musical numbers contribute significantly to this evolution, and it seems nobody has thought at Disney that include songs in a child film is from another era. The end result is precisely what was intended to avoid the film, being a product ñoño and overly sweetened. If the Ribbon is more than bearable for adult audiences is through the interpretation of Amy Adams, although occasionally his exageradísima voice of pito can cause a slight attack of nerves.
