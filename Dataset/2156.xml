	<summary>To see the viewer feels like one of those twelve men who have in their hands the life of a boy of 18 years.</summary>
	<body>This film manages to convey what you intend to, it is intense and suffocating, that is why it is set on the hottest day of the year, we see almost all the characters sweating and then gets on top to rain to create an atmosphere of oppressive humid heat. This seems an unimportant detail, to my seems quite important, because if one day solitude and normal film would not be equal.Apart from this, we have 12 characters locked in a room, it is everything we have throughout the film, there is no change of scenario, except when they go to the service. To see the viewer feels like one of those twelve men who have in their hands the life of a boy of 18 years, they must decide whether he is innocent or guilty and everyone is convinced that is blame, less one, the character of Henry Fonda (which is spectacular), he has a reasonable doubt and from thereIt will try to convince others that cannot be taken lightly a decision like that.The characters are very well shaped, each one has a personality perfectly marked and that influences their views and the reasons that have to give their verdict.The camera moves lead us from one place to another room as if were there with them passing heat and deciding if a boy lives or dies; the close-ups that bring us closer to the psychology of the characters, this is a film of characters, is of the actors, only and exclusively yours and we must say that we all do very well and endure the close-up excellently are abundant and that isn't easy.With this film Sidney Lumet indicates that a very good film can be done with little money and few resources.</body>
