	<summary>Now or never is not more than a simplistic and vulgar sentimentaloide comedy whose sole attraction is seen doing the clown a histrionic and unleashed Jack Nicholson.</summary>
	<body>The first months of the year tend to be dominated by the premieres of all the favorite movies of face to the season of awards in United States, both which finally come to be candidates, as are on the way. But among all these releases is also customary that slip other types of films, Hollywood with big aspirations of blockbuster comedies.Now or never is a good example, a story that has the last days of life of two men who suffer from cancer, but that far from surrender, decide to spend the little time that is left of life big as a tragicomedy. Said sounds very hopeful, but clear, should be the fate of being or meet a millionaire to do it, if it is slightly unbalanced as the character of Jack Nicholson, much better. Finally, a story that could have been fun is wasted here by easy sentimentality by Rob Reiner, real specialist in the genre. The story takes horrors to boot, and is the first third seems taken from a melodrama cheap. In what appears the histrionic vein of the great Jack Nicholson film back, but more by the genius of Nicholson and their expressions than by the screenplay or the ability to Reiner. Another negative detail of the film is how bad that sequences are carried with chroma, which are too obvious and evident.Now or never is not more than a simplistic and vulgar sentimentaloide comedy whose sole attraction is seen doing the clown a histrionic and unleashed Jack Nicholson. And it is that there are few actors who alone are able to make fun a regrettable script.</body>
