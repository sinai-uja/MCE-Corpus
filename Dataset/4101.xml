	<body>Unsurpassed debut of the editor of various films of the genus JEFF BETANCOURT as working in his facet as in recent successes such as the exorcism of Emily rose or cry 2 among many others.Counting with a cast they Excel where two faces known, RENEE O CONNOR popular for their participation in the XENA series and the protagonist of the saga SAW TOBIN BELL.¿Por puzzle what an impressive debut? Suppose that more than one remembered that unbearable crappy I mean BOOGEYMAN becoming one of the worst years of the genre releases. With these twigs give the realization of a second part did not seem a priori a very sound idea.Look for where the psychological factor of the original is changed by the SLASHER of life in is continuation which fortunately has nothing to do with the above providing a grisly deaths in all the footage where takes place a few excellent makeup effects. Also outstanding photography, the script offers a somewhat more mature reading of which is expected in this type of production.Some characters are clearly something flat that its only function is to be despedazados by the assassin something totally understandable knowing what it is though the set is certainly entertaining leaving the name of the debutante at pretty good place for the future.</body>
