	<body>Last night made me a trucazo I am still giving laps. I went to the 'other' movie of wizards of the season, the good. You know, there are times that gather in billboard a couple of movie ranging from same: Finding Nemo and El Espantatiburones, Antz and bugs, Armaggedon and Deep Impact, wild Madagascar. they are almost always children's films, but this time it was a very adult film: the trick last (the Prestige) which has won by a landslide to the Ilusionista.La film, with a bright characterization and atmosphere presents the rivalry between two magicians. and here I can read, because it is really very difficult to comment this film without gutting one of the surprises and twists that has the script for the movie, but if you can say that it has a splendid picture, some performances by Hugh Jackman and especially by Christian Bale very good, and also get Scarlett JohanssonMichael Caine. and David Bowie! Really necessary viewing.The history plays to the mistake during the footage, when you think something, it is just the opposite, and that thought believe that turns out to be an illusion that will then be transformed into the beginning of a new trick. Sometimes it goes well, and other times you'll find it half. The address is correct, very much in the style of Nolan and music meets its mission: her can not be seen.In short, a Nolan of transition between Batman Begins and The Dark Night leaving the Phanes, who are many very good taste.</body>
