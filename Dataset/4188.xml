	<summary>Up to the hour of footage does not appear nor one and when decide to enter in action see four kids with makeup that it seems to chalk, pace slow where except for the bottom seems a dramatic movie.</summary>
	<body>Film scheduled be orchestrated by the author of the massacre of Texas TOOBE HOOPER after failing agreement is replaced by CARDONE author of vampires in the desert or death in 8 MM 2. A cast composed of Chloe Moretz displayed on the nine versions of THE EYE and LORI HEURING wears in the pleasant summer of seduction.Practically the work of the interpreters is the best thing in this disaster, with a title so unequivocal as ZOMBIES is therefore expected to see precisely many of them. Up to the hour of footage does not appear nor one and when decide to enter in action see four kids with makeup that it seems to chalk, pace slow where except for the bottom seems a dramatic movie.Little budget left note in all paragraphs technical associate with mediocre makeup, the nursery school photography, music that is not right at any time in a direction of the horrible Mr cardone.Little you save from this crappy.</body>
