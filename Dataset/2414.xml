	<summary>The tape becomes a mere experiment, which, like the soda worth making at home and then save it in a drawer, the highest possible view of others.</summary>
	<body>I know that you I referred to this film in my opinion on "Once upon a time a tale to the upside down.", but it was not until a conversation with my brother-in-law, faithful reader of this page (take to send you a greeting!)Hello Joselito!), when I have been pushed to see the tape, even though he qualified with a mere experiment, which had to do, was curiosity and his opinion that took me to see for myself.It is an original way, ever seen, this to animate with peanuts and other nuts, that it falls on deaf ears, of course, but that despite the excellent band sound, debtor of the film by Tim Burton (and with some touches of sound with great Danny Elfman), just that, in a mere anecdote, of short duration (hour and nothing more room)with a language of their own and a debtor of cinema of terror and suspense plot, it gets only interested a bit original of his plateamiento.And is that peanuts express barely anything, and one sometimes thinks that it is losing a few min. precious in doing anything else, and not see as two types move over and over again about "panchitos" the screen, part of the dubbing, think of those facts by 2 coleguita plan total joke.Finally, I share the opinion of my brother-in-law, and it is that, as the said, the tape becomes a mere experiment, which, like the soda worth making at home and then save it in a drawer, the highest possible view of others.</body>
