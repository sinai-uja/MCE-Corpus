	<body>Steven Soderbergh appears to put an end to the adventures of the gang with this third installment (thing that never know, go to know what raises this), more accessible (and therefore less enjoyable and evil) than the second installment and with a tone more friendly and suitable for all ages and minds.On this occasion, the team commanded by Clooney and Pitt (because in fact interpreted in themselves) are retaliate of an evil rogue to the life-giving Pacino on vacation also, why not, which betrays Reuben (Elliott Gould) into a multi-million dollar business leaving him in a terrible situation?Then is when the gang goes into action and is then when differentiate clearly the tone of the film, clear, accessible and direct, as in the first installment. In Ocean? s13 there are no experiments, or Nouvelle vague streams, or jump cuts, nor deprived of dubious taste jokes. We are going, it is not as badass as it was Ocean? s 12, the best in my opinion.There are some good gag, some "made in Soderbergh" level and a permanent cleavage of Ellen Barkin, but there are also times, gaps and moments sosotes which are noted, as well as scenes of comedy, the worst in the trilogy.Fails to load the foundations of a sympathetic dominguera trilogy with style but it is a step back to Steven Soderbergh, although many think that in the case of the adventures of Danny Ocean and his boys this even count as curriculum.</body>
