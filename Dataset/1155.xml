	<body>Do they have ever known someone that puts the other cheek receive a slap in the face?I ask you because if the answer is Yes, it is likely that the known is the protagonist of "Lights at dusk", a film with pseudo-intellectuals pretensions and that, therefore, the rest of mortals, far away from the divine hand see the art there where it is, we may be quite boring.The argument could be summed up in the following way: a man that gets very badly with everyone but not because sing the forties to all borderlines who is on his way, he simply does nothing. He sits and watching life passing, they laugh at him, well okay, that they stick, then okay, they will cheat, well okay, there is only a person who wants, as it passes from that person. In short, as they can see what it says is an intelligent type. This very interesting story is added the expressivity of his actors, static factions that like silicone breasts, gives equal how are, where they are and who they are, they always remain the same.That Yes the picture is very nice and the protagonist is very paltry, very miserable, and already why one should assume that the film is good? I, personally, to see stagnant images of very paltry people prefer to give me a tour of the Museo del Prado and observe Goya's black paintings (although that Yes, the plot is more interesting and critical). Ah! By the way, if you know someone well, tell him to change because it does enough damage to the human condition.</body>
