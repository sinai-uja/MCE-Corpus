	<body>"In the year 1895, in Madrid, the political situation is unstable, happening continuous changes in the direction of the nation." People do what's always, gossip in visits, try to know a good boyfriend girls, and vice versa boys.However, a lady, virtuosa, but courageous and determined, not willing to take the lives of other women, making la tonta, smiling constantly before the crap of the hombres.y not working. So, neither short nor lazy, it is directed to the Ministry to ask for work. Such unprecedented, known, will lead a discussion at the national level on whether women should and/or can work along with the men. And again, nothing less servant. "Well, it is accepted and began to work in the post offices, being infinitely more diligent, hardworking than men, which will cause both praise and strong hatred".Extraordinary comedy the great Fernando Fernán Gómez, hilarious all the footage. You laugh a lot a good number of scenes (all occurring at the post office with simpar Erasmo Pascual de official first), and you smile all the time. Beautifully directed, with some superb performances (Erasmo Pascual, Analía Gadé, Joaquín Roa) at the head, a perfect ambiance in charge of the great Santiago Ontañón, and a beautiful picture in black and white of Ricardo Torres. It leaves a sediment of bienhestar hardly managed to film today.</body>
