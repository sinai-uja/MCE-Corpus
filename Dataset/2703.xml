	<summary>Interesting French film that has been slow to be released in the Spanish commercial theaters.</summary>
	<body>Quite entertaining and interesting French movie, directed with mimo although not too much imagination by Philipe Loiret, for my an unknown filmmaker.It is narrated in a clear way and interest increases as the minutes pass and we know more details of the stranger who has come to the place "more paragraph in the world", as stated several times during the film.The orography of place, as well as customs and idiosyncrasy of the inhabitants, they become protagonists of what is happening gradually. And the sea, almost always enraged, threatening, that without the lighthouse of the place could be the tomb of a good number of people.The pace is suitable to combine scenes of dramatic tension, together with intimistas, where looks and silences, as well as small details on the objects of the houses.The history of love, of vital importance, is expressing with touch and feeling.To make the film entertaining, help the good acting work of all / as the / as interpreters, especially the marriage composed by Philippe Torreton and Sandrine Bonnaire, both terrific and very well adjusted in their respective roles. As co-star, Grégore Derangère, perhaps is you should blame does not change almost never face. It shall be said that it is for his introspective character, but the truth is that not abound in him the nuances.Good times, as everything that happens on the feast of July 14, and a final, the last scene, really emotional. In short, I do not think that it is an excellent film work, although the technical section is exquisite, as the excellent music by Nicola Piovani, but it has a pleasant aroma and repent not one to have seen.</body>
