	<body>Dramatic comedy film directed by Finn Taylor, in her second film after ten years of drought in the direction. Starring Joseph Fiennes, who knows how to carry all the weight of the comical with Winona Ryder, which becomes you see so expl√©ndida on screen.The truth is that the tape, at times a little is chorra, but manages to play with the comical of the spectator and at other times start some another smile in the audience, it is also true to the bullshit of deaths I have come to remind the saga of teen horror "Final destination", where the only thing that was worth was the way to die, to more chorra and far-fetched better.Accompany these two a huge number of side, such as David Arquette, Chris Penn, Julianna Margulies as well as Juliette Lewis, in this film than in with a light touch of SERIE B and low-budget film, achieved in a short space of footage leave with a good feeling and a pleasant taste.It entretiende, fun and like, apart from entertaining his approach and know laugh of something as serious as death.</body>
