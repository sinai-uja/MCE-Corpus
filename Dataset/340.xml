	<summary>One of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. Failed product that does not deserve further comment</summary>
	<body>The truth is that I went to the movies without having played any of the parts of the famous video game, simply because the argument and the aesthetics of the film attracted me and I thought that it might an entertaining production (good would be too much to ask) but I was completely wrong.Silent Hill I think one of the worst movies I've seen in recent years. There are some aspects that are very accomplished, as the effects and photography, but still fail to change my adjective. Becomes heavy, absurd characters, script (do?) confusing that requires much of an explanation even after we made a character, creatures which are not too tale (I guess that in the video game Yes), a parallel worlds, situations that left you cold totally. And I say all this because it's funny that with Christophe Gans (Brotherhood of the Wolf, crying freeman), Roger Avary (the rules of the game, Killing Zoe, writer of Pulp Fiction) and Dan Laustsen (Mimic, the Pact of the wolves) as director, screenwriter and cinematographer respectively, has created a bad product.There are some aspects as I said are they saved from burning, and among them we find his cast: Radha Mitchell (Melinda and Melinda) and Sean Bean (Boromir in the Lord of the rings) show that they are a few very interesting players and they are delivered, that have been able to recreate the experiences of such tormented parents. Ultimately a failed product that does not deserve further comment.</body>
