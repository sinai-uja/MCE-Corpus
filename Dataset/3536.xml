	<summary>Irregular and somewhat disjointed, but quite corrosive criticism of intolerance.</summary>
	<body>A King already quite adult, should move to New York as its Prime Minister has taken all the money. The people believed that he had stolen, but it had been the other.In New York it will be live on pensions, but the hotel is very expensive, so it must earn a living. "And it does thanks to television and radio."Satire political, somewhat excessive and somewhat disjointed but quite corrosive, of what happened to Chaplin in reality, when he had to leave from Los United States "thank you" to the unlucky "hunting for witches" of Hollywood.Chaplin, thanks to the humor, with so many good gags Visual and, above all, verbal, achieves a complaint, perhaps a child at times, but sincere and honest.The "touch" to the last works, although it is true that it is irregular in its development, being much better his first half than the rest.The House UN-American activities Committee members are ridiculed by a sovereign manguerazo, with a running gag of silent film that, despite being fairly predictable, works. And the informing, normal practice in the happy time of the hunting of witches, is exposed for hard but not too convincing, through the child character, with such political, touching and unnerving pitagorín at a time.Controversial film, that equally, practically has been insulted and vindicated. I'll stick with that it is not one of his greatest works, but it is a very interesting film exercise. Oh!, and Dawn Addams, beautiful.</body>
