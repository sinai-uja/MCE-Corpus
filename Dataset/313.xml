	<body>Anywhere in which you read about "Thumbsucker" tell the same: "is about a boy who at the age of 17, still sucks the finger". And Yes, it is true, but, obviously, this is just the beginning. "Thumbsucker" is one of those American movies, in the line of "You, me and everyone else", telling the daily tragedies through characters that are unique within its normal. "Comedy drama", they call it some.In any case, the first job as director of feature films of Mike Mills based on fixation by sucking the finger of the main character to finish covering issues such as family relations or the dissatisfaction with life. And it is entertaining, and it is touching at times, but just not materialize at all. The film is based on a novel by Walter Kirn, I do not know. I do not know how will be the book, but his adaptation has a fundamental problem: the screenplay delves into aspects then abandoned completely, as the treatment of the protagonist to your problem. Without going to appreciate the criticism that the film seems to want to do on drugs psychiatric use, which I do not agree with, is that the director becomes the subject of the medication and drugs a fundamental axis, then forget about him as if such thing. I was not very clear why something which seems to be so important in a time ceases to be fifteen minutes later. On the other hand, the performances of the actors are good, although lost as a result in some cases, and personally, I think they could have gotten much more party the role of Keanu Reeves. Come on, "Thumbsucker" has its charms, but expected me more. The truth, I prefer that Todd Solondz is which tell me the dramas of happy families.</body>
