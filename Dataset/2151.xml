	<body>Dictator Idi Amin, who interprets Forest Whitaker had a very complex personality, as it could be extraordinarily charming and be capable of the most brutal and bloody crimes. He has been much of his performance in this film, and rightly so, because it is impressive, from the first moment in which appears this character already scary, although at the beginning it pretends to be a nice man, reflects perfectly the double aspect of the personality of the dictator.The protagonist is a young doctor who decides to go to Africa in search of adventure and also with intent to assist in humanitarian work, in the end will be exercising as the personal physician of the dictator and as your trusted advisor, which initially is a good relationship between the two, will be turning into something much more dangerous.The doctor is played by James McAvoy, whose best-known so far role was as the Faun of the Chronicles of Narnia, in his first role of weight makes it quite well, although not noted both as a Forest Whitaker.En as the rest of the movie nor there is much stress, the head is the Scottish Kevin Mcdonald, director of documentaries, in some moments the film seems to be filmed as a documentary, although this not bother because the performance of Forest fills the screen.</body>
