	<summary>Becomes to assassinate the work of Carpenter with a first part that is a prequel impoverished development with topics always shattered family and the second with murders to the rhythm of music video.</summary>
	<body>Director John Carpenter must ask itself what I did to deserve this? With the previous remakes perpetrated for the greater glory of two of his major works "the fog and assault" on Precinct 13. Apparently they shot to destroy the originals, if that was not the intention is as came out.It seemed that it could run better luck on halloween, first hired a director caused a great impression with his earlier work. Of course Rob Zombie was based in the world of authors of gender with the credentials of the House of the thousand corpses and sequel.Above a cast full of great performers known for the fan. People like BRAD DOURIF "Spontaneous combustion" KEN FOREE "Zombie", ADRIENNE BARBEAU "La Niebla" or the great Malcolm MCDOWELL "Clockwork Orange" in addition to SID HAIG and others seen in the previous films of the director. More than one are rubbing their hands with the result.Because gentlemen stop rubbing them because it becomes to assassinate the work of Carpenter with a first part that is a prequel of impoverished development with topics always shattered family. My mother drug, my father is a drunk, so I put the mask it and begin to kill.The second part are simply murders at rate of video-clip, all too fast, without the slightest edge plot. A Myers most lethal but losing great planning levels and the anguish that aired the original.The best is undoubtedly the quality of the always outstanding Malcom McDowell otherwise it might have been spared.
