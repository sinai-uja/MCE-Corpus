	<body>Yimou Zhang is not pure whim one of the most respected Asian directors. Its fantastic curriculum ("Hero", "Tiger and Dragon", "The curse of the Golden Flower") will delight anyone. Its exquisite taste to shoot the film makes palpable in each of their productions. It should not be a great critic to admire the class and style of Zhang when wheel martial arts scenes. If I said in "The curse of the Golden Flower" that the characters, rather than fight seemed to dance, here they seem to Dioses.Y is that Yimou shows us a stunning action scenes that will delight everyone. Yimou also brings an impressive party to natural locations (attention to the impressive fight in the bamboo forest).Actors may not be best in their respective roles. From Zhang Ziyi, unfairly non-nominated for the Oscars for "Memoirs of a Geisha" to Takeshi Kaneshiro. All are wonderful in their roles and, in addition to shoot such as impressive action scenes, give his characters of sufficient strength so that the end has enough drama to make us cry.The "easiest", call it somehow would be the script. Although it is supported by if only and is robust enough to take the film forward, is Yimou which gives enough strength and spectacular to make the film what it is.Impressive would be the word for the whole team of pre-production, production and post-production. From that wonderful artistic direction to this magnificent soundtrack.A highly recommended movie for lovers of martial arts and love stories.</body>
