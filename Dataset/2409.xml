	<summary>Animated film you must see (must support animation, hermos@s) but leaves a strange taste when it ends.</summary>
	<body>Most of the tapes made by digital animation have many pros and some against, "Robots" is not an exception, the pros, which is brilliantly made, which seems even a film made with the method "Stop-Motion" (for those who do not know who is!)Search for it in Google! (Which am not going to waste time explaining I), and that the voices more in you than dubbed (even if Flo does not do wrong and "the mountain" on duty, either, go) are great. The against? The script, that although comes signed by two writers of comedy (city Cowboys, A mess father; sweet home sometimes) is quite simple, linear and predictable nauseam, in fact, I would say more, is come the end of all the events from the 5th minute of film.It is true that the Fox (and BlueSky in this case) leave with this film years light to the also brilliant "The ice age" (that taking advantage of the premiere of "Robots" is out on DVD with a "ultrachachi-great" Edition), however and although as I have already said the animation is excellent, both Pixar and Dreamworks have done extraordinary work such as "The Incredibles" and "Shrek-2" that leave this as a "mere Apprentice" of the above and while the tributes and coleteos to the 7th art history (from "the wizard of Oz" to Fritz Lang's "Metropolis") are more than patents, the movie falters in simplicity, perhaps because the topic that the animation is only for "nanos" continue thinking?Finally, an animated film you must see (must support animation, hermos@s) but leaves a strange taste when it ends.</body>
