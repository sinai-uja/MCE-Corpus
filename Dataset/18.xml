	<summary>What bad is the nostalgia</summary>
	<body>Now is when left as a geek to say. I liked a lot!!! Above all, sure, when the camera gets in the foreground as it was the game. Ainss, what memories. The only thing I missed is that it became immortal mode and advanced punching. Although it does in part.Okay, first of all, the movie is bad, very bad. But the nostalgia I can. Especially when it gets in first person, of course. the rest no longer a cocktail of hundreds and hundreds of action films that we have seen on many other occasions, fills the topics of these films (attitudes, components of the Group and similar, topical that I love by the way). If you liked, to give a couple of examples predator and Aliens, the return, this film follows that route (although does not, not even close to the results of those), is a film that I call "bug hunt", there are bugs and kill them. Neither more nor less. The attempt to make one of the most interesting characters to have problems with a woman that are in the scientific complex (no, it is not what you think, it is her sister) continues to be a failed attempt, because, frankly, what is less important in the film is family relations as the protagonists, mola is hunting bugs. and in that sense, if with the exception of the scenes in the foreground (and not to be here excessive, everything must be said), is quite short. Apart from certain situations as the appearance of a scientist do not know very well where does when the complex should be evacuated, but come on. Apart from these small details.Ehmm, vale, for the majority of the readers of this blog would not even mildly interesting, but pussy. the nostalgia. ainss</body>
