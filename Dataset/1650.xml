	<body>Always maligned serie B, managed budgets and creative pulse with the majors, they impose their aesthetic criterion on coup d ' book, detour (Detour) has one of its summits and the time, the implacable judge, has respected and established itself as a cult film.This road-movie (the term was not yet exploited) was recorded in the amazing space of six days and cost even more staggering 20. all dollars. There are lost roads, pictures that deep America grim as an accomplice in the iconography of the film noir, squalid motel rooms, women live dubious and even German Expressionism brought to the United States.UU by a formidable barque of directors who saw a vehicle to enlarge his art and make history (Lang, Sirk, Wilder or this Edgar g. Ulmer of minor fame) in Hollywood.It is not that the script is formidable. There is a cast in State of grace, as it is often said. The reason why this thickened film classics payroll is its genuine condition rarity, their ability to make a gem of film with such fragile mimbres (money, anonymous actors campus, the indent of B series) while another film of conditioning similar as So dark the night of Joseph H. Lewis.Flashbacks, voice-overs and a master's degree absolute in the treatment of the abrupt landscape make Detour a troubled workopen to many lectures. The most obvious, its beauty, its own way of telling a story (everything happens through the sieve of the eyes of Robert, the protagonist, pianist who goes in search of his girlfriend and encountered, on the road, with a murder he did not commit and a fatal woman, another that blackmailing him). Tom Neal, actor who gives life, takes in real life the reins of serie B and the film noir he went to prison in 1965 for killing his third wife.</body>
