	<body>Stephen King has been brought to the film on numerous occasions. Some of them have been a failure. 1408 isn't directed by Stanley Kubrick, that much is clear, but it is not sufficient excuse to not reach a level minimally well. It is, for the most part, disappointing. John Cusack never me has fallen especially well. Samuel l. Jackson Yes. Undoubtedly personal, the problem is that the latter appears little more of ten minutes, and the other during the film, although its presence does not end bother me at all. I see enough reason as to not have caught me in its seemingly interesting plot premise. Yes, the beginning is pretty good, but as he is advancing, the script will decline (and the room also). It is a film that has its moments (if not them bit him would be to be a real crappy), but most of them are or topical or meaningless. His biggest problem, undoubtedly, is the lack of suspense after the viewer has seen that anything can happen. From the resuscitation of the protagonist after die knifed (is only an example) the average wild fauna in the happy room appearance. All can occur, and thus it is impossible to believe her. And the script? Ducks, incoerente, bad, very bad. This is probably one of the biggest disappointments of the previous year. That heche to tremble Hafström if Kubrick resurrects.</body>
