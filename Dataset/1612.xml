	<summary>Adaptation of the work of Douglas Adams. A tape that have to do with some degree of complicity, but leave much to be desired.</summary>
	<body>The Galactic Hitchhiker guide is a series of books created by Douglas Adams, who have been waiting centuries its adaptation to the big screen, finally and after hundreds of negotiations finally is has brought to fruition the film, after a TV series which only saw in GB.To say that the film is a masterpiece would be lying, it would also say that it is bad, because we are not before anything like "Star Wars" and "Star Trek" or anything else like, a tape of absurd humor that from the very beginning must continue the game and immerse in the story to tell without more pretensions than the spend a fun time, the type of humor perhaps remember somewhere that another occasion to the monty python with the crazy humor and those designs that although great can fall from time to time in the most absolute of the mediocrity.Several moments to make this something special tape, the principle that explains as we humans (and the song of the dolphins), the image of the whale, and the "translator element", all based on a comedy series "jam" that, or is this in total harmony with the film or seem a supine bullshit.Interpretive plot, highlight to Sam Rockwell, in a role originally intended for Jim Carrey, who manages with his character be afraid to have someday head elsewhere, Martin Freeman, that brings that image does not know very well where walks needs the main character, and Marvin, the trapped robot in the depression, which provides voice Alan Rickman.Resumiendoa tape that have to do with some degree of complicity, but leave much to be desired.</body>
