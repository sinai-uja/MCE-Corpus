	<body>"A man enters a large House which is for rent and discovers a corpse." But it is also a beautiful girl scared and a ratero. When they are talking about trying to be clarified, called at the door. They are a beautiful woman and two men, deaf and moulting. "But they aren't clean wheat."Very entertaining film of suspense in its stage, logically, English magician.Appreciating the constants that would always keep climax expressing, well sustained intrigue and suspense in some scenes.Well directed, yes you can see today, which makes true grace, the use of models, such as the intense scene of the train and the bus going in parallel. But we must take account of the year in which it is directed.Humor and action well combined and short duration, as it was customary then.It leaves good taste.It is Queenie in their main roles by Leon M. Lion, Anne Grey. John Stuart. Donald Calthrop, Barry Jones. Ann Casson, Henry Caine and Garry Marsh. It is British production and the year 1932.</body>
