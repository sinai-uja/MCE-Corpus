	<body>Finally I've labeled "Babel" of the list, it was time. And I was delighted; undoubtedly one of the best movies I've seen lately. Alejandro González Iñárritu's first feature film, "love dogs", I liked a lot - not "21 grams", that left me something cold - but "Babel" surpasses all that. I understand that it is quite long. I dunno, to me I went flying. The four stories had me completely hooked until the end. The Japan, despite being possibly the least "tragic" and the more desligada of the rest - or precisely - why, I touched especially by this way to portray a much less obvious drama. Interpretations of the actors are spectacular. It is also the agility and, above all, humanity with which the director has put in scene this magnificent but difficult, script by Guillermo Arriaga. Among all have managed to show consistency and without superficiality completely different worlds, narrate tragedies without falling into sentimentality and transmit tenderness despite all the imperfections and mistakes of the characters. For a change, I had to do bent. How occur to someone bending this film? I suppose it would have been even better in the original version, but in any case, "Babel" won that increasingly more difficult as the years pass. I left the cinema excited, "played", feel different to as had entered and reflecting on what he had just seen. And why I recommend her you do not let pass.</body>
