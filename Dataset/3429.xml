	<summary>Lynch, SciFi "of tó life" and many bad host in a sadly cursed movie in the film Spanish. A delusion that needs an audience willing to be carried away.</summary>
	<body>Review The Birthday, the movie of Eugenio Mira, and me happened it big. I have to admit that when I saw her for the first time it was Virgin (very very very Virgin) and I saturated both for good and for evil.View the edition published on dvd by Versus (re) discover an intense, imaginative and absolutely hilarious film filled with flat sequences, bizarre characters, Lynch, Scifi50's and racing a little to Buñuel. But racing.All these references give the perfect film, so credible atmosphere as Donnie Darko Amen to retrieve for the big screen to Corey Feldman, a compelling reason to not miss the film now that her we can buy in the Court English. A delicious madness which thank you view it at home because I remember the climax in the movie theater with the volume at full blast and it still hurts the ears. The flat end is a joy.PS: I remember that the version screened at the sample of the Palafox was in real-time. Let us not forget that the movie are the minutes rare 117 of the life of Norman Forrester. The dvd is a correct "cut" of 96'.</body>
