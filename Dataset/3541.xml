	<body>Doubly bad, double sleeping and doubly wrong performed by Edu Noriega, but not only him, all actors are fatal, and when this happens already I've said a thousand times is the fault of the director; Vicente Aranda throw a fart and as a result is born love songs at LOLITAÂ´S CLUB, a story composed of fragments that not lead us anywhere, where the art direction leaves a lot to be desired and in whose viewing will feel the imperative of get off the seat and go to vomit.This film follows the same line as the previous Sr.Aranda, loose the plot and poorly interpreted. I expected much of this movie, have suffered a spiritual aneurysm before such vision. And that I am super fan of the two protagonists why even more gets me the pathetic outcome of the movie.By the way at the premiere of the movie the director Mr not agreed one of the names of their actresses alluding a: "as I head" when going to present them.</body>
