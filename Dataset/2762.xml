	<body>GREG MCLEAN soon released another starring a giant crocodile horror film ROGUE debuted big with this work that comes with huge delay to our screens.Do not expect anything new, what counts saw him previously in works of great significance for the genre fans. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the hills have eyes among many others. The interpreters are young regulars at TV clamoring in his country that practically made their debut on the big screen. The merits of the debut not should seek interpretations or the script.Its true merits reside in the great management showing MCLEAN to create distress. The slow pace of the film is another of its strengths, by placing less action most certainly shocking moments-reaching.A real return to the 1970s where sick photography and the atmosphere created around the characters make this debut one of the greatest achievements of the horror of recent times.Hopefully the new work of the filmmaker to assess whether we are facing a new legend of the genre. 8.</body>
