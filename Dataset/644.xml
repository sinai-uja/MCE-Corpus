	<body>I've always thought that the assassination of Kennedy and the arrival of the man to the Moon, the third great mystery of the twentieth century was none other than the fact that Nicolas Cage won an Academy Award. And I never tire of saying that we we have one of the players with less records that one can imagine. If you capture a frame of each of his films, you can hardly differentiate its expression, whether of comedy, action, drama or mystery: always the same face. And the worst thing is that when you try to change the registry, it is even more terrible, because then the only thing that makes is strangely distort the eyebrows, forehead creasing and adopt a histrionic image causing shame others. When won the devalued statuette from the Academy (today probably affects more money spent on promotion to artistic quality to achieve) with Leaving las Vegas, Mike Figgis, director of the film, due to be so amazed that until today, and it's been eleven years, he hasn't done anything worthwhile too. Perhaps to not leave too ridiculous to Cage, the rest of the actors also do quite mediocre work. For a change, The Wicker Man is another of these adaptations of films of the seventies that turns out to be worse than the original, with more resources, but with fewer ideas. In this case with any because it is a calque of the first. In my opinion it is intended to be an allegory which is to see that a world dominated by women would be just as bad as ours, because the evil lies not in the sex of the people, but that it is found in the power that corrupts us. The last twenty-five minutes are quite entertaining; the rest just bearable. You will tell.</body>
