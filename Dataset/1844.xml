	<body>"The black book" (Zwartboek) means the return of Paul Verhoeven to his native Holland and the truth, could hardly be a more happy return because the critical success has accompanied him a remarkable commercial success. More it cannot be.The script tells the story of a young Jew who, after various vicissitudes, joins the resistance fighting against the nazi occupation of Holland. Written by Gerard Soeteman and the Verhoeven himself is part of the gender patterns of spies in its aspect II war Mundial.Verhoeven gives the film a true classic tone while adding his personal, clearly visible touch the frankness of the treatment of violence and sex, two of the recurring themes in his filmography.What elevates the film, in addition to the above, above the average of the films of its genre, perhaps the unusual depth of characters and great performances of the cast, headed by a Carice van Houten that endows his character of beauty, sensuality and unusual in an actress of just 30 years maturity.Her seconded effective Thom Hoffman and Sebastian Koch, in State of grace after also intervene in the winner of the Academy Award for best foreign language film "The lives of others", which gives the necessary human to his role as general nazi and a hard touch. The rest of side are also luxury.Surprisingly, although perhaps it should not be coming from Verhoeven, some moments of pure suspense, entretenid√≠sima which is the film and the ability to tell the epic of the protagonist in a reasonable amount of time, in addition, spent you flying to the Viewer.In short, film before, good film, not exempt from depth and whose ironic and disheartening end (and thereby betraying nothing) should make us reflect.Moonfleet.es rating: 9 out of 10</body>
