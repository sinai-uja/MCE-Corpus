	<summary>More vampires, more fine offal for a film that does nothing at all</summary>
	<body>By God, that big eyes that you have put on the poster this girl. But it was because then you have a bad milk which seems that they have inserted a chilli in salva is the part, I would ask an eye donation.The film is a girl who lives in a circus held by his strange abilities. One day, by the vicissitudes of fate, he escapes from the circus killing half shooting (by adjusting the budget). Then appears a group belonging to the Brimstone society, that liquid left and begin to search for the supposed vampire that has bundled all the chicken. At the end it turns out she is a Dhampir (folleteo between human and vampire) and want in your group. His mission, kill the strongest vampire of the moment. And then there is a collection of pieces of vampire which is very funny thing.We face another one of vampires, with the novelty water kills them (should smell to blessed glory). Taken from a comic book, the film does much to the genre. We have a player who wants to kill a supervampiro on logical grounds, a group that you also want to do it and on the other side, the vampire who wants to dominate the world. News? No. So we have a script that we already know, with some characters that do not kill and a surprising however absurd final resolution. The dark aesthetics adjusts quite well to what you expect of a comic, as well as the soundtrack. But to tell the truth, it is pretty bad.In short, more vampires, more fine offal for a film that does nothing at all. If you are a fan of the genre possibly the grills, but let it pass as in the mus.</body>
