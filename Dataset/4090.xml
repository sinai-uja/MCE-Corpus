	<summary>We have a great masterpiece of our time.</summary>
	<body>Before I write anything, the first thing I will do is say that the film contains a "twist" from the 100 minute of projection, but, as I'm not such a bad person (despite what some might think) not desvelaré it here, so anyone who wants to know more, you know.That being said (and eye to my detractors, since I'm going to talk about more things than usual) Clint Eastwood has proven to be a solid director of actors, as demonstrated with "Mystic River" and "M$ B" does so masterfully, estetíca the film is little more than A C O J O N A N T E images they come to let "sediment" in the spectatorin the 1st 100 minutes of film are witnessing the birth and subsequent redemption of a promising young boxing and a "coach" makes possible (not wanting in advance) by his pupil to achieve what is proposed. Some plans, parts of the script and gestures of the actors do and get that you are "hair like hooks". But there is that which will. !!Much less! In the last twenty minutes (with the twist that I did not desvelaré) Eastwood takes the film far beyond what one expected, demonstrating that it is able to tell two stories in one, and leave us after the opening credits with the mind crushed by the moments lived in the armchair. Also Mr.Eastwood (which already seen older) composed the score, directs, acts. !!We are going Juan palomo, I me him stew, I I the as! And if to this we add the excellent interpretation of Hillary Swank and Morgan Freeman!We have a great masterpiece of our time! I hope that the Oscars are favorable to him and win all the nominations which is nominated. To that you expect to see?</body>
