	<body>I always think that our country is that of the blind in the cinematographic field, not term I explain the because British director SHANE MEADOWS recognized in half the world by their enormous talent, therefore here either premiere their films.His previous work DEAD MAN SHOES could catalogue you small wonder and a reflection on the revenge with a load of portentosa violence.Down much tone although it's certainly remains true to his style of extreme hardness comes his first premiere at our lares with the name THIS IS ENGLAND with rather poor distribution as expected.The issue is not novel focusing on SKINHEADS or also called shorn heads, addressed on several occasions by film as break STROPER, Clockwork Orange, HOOLIGANS and many more examples of gang members or youth bands that always gave lot of game.Between this narrative style mixing it with the social drama English relates us brilliantly without sutilizas a descent into hell by a young ignored in society that only receives the love of these criminals.Between decay shows the drama of beings lost in a very sad story really full of bitterness with a final open to hope.Interpretations of the Prodigy THOMAS TURGOOSE seen in the series innocent project and STEPHEN Graham in the same series is also seen in GOAL are really portentous giving credibility at all times to the drama that require their characters.Photography, music, script are practically outstanding giving us a devastating set you unfortunately will not have much significance in our lares.</body>
