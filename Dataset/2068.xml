	<body>Effective film that recounts the last days almost with historical rigor of a decrepito Adolf Hitler in a bunquer in Berlin, it is curious to see many of the gestures that we have seen in historical reports excellently played by Bruno Ganz, director Oliver Hirschbiegel that already address the amazing "The experiment" used for the film some blue tones and are becoming softer towards the end of the tapea staff of excellent actors and a soundtrack that although brief is fully satisfactory.Perhaps the only downside I see to the tape is their excessive duration 150 min and its a little slow and linear development with some situations do not do more than repeat during the footage until the satiety (although, in a war, to be honest, nor is there much creativity).Powerfully calls me attention to where comes the total eccentricity of Hitler, which gives equal to 80% and although completely decentered get carried much of his men ahead. !!If it is that this man was a little asshole!In short, an excellent movie to see the other side of that be petty that it was Adolf Hitler.</body>
