	<body>A sequel to the original surpass is really difficult to talk about a series (b) direct the video seems virtually impossible. As a director with Australia coming talent called BRIAN TRENCHARD SMITH which usually shine in aftermath of order that I performed two notable contributions to the LEPRECHAUM saga without forget that her debut was the sympathetic flying bike. A deal higher than the average in this type of product with CRISTI HARRIS television seen in series such as SANSET BEACH or the veteran JENNIFER RHODES participated in the hit series ALLY MACBEAL. The script is even more work to that of his predecessor out of the usual clichés that one abused, again is must outline the technical aspects above all the great work of make-up. A frenetic pace with good development that gives a good entertainment surpassing in many respects to the original showing that sometimes is possible the impossible.Like the previous one very funny.</body>
