	<summary>Visual poem by syncopated orgasms and metaphysical cramps. I.e., a hodgepodge of little utility that just forgetting without excessive effort.</summary>
	<body>Hedonistic Divertimento worthy of include jewelry freaks of the year, capricho indie of dubious artistic taste that appeals to the curiosity and a supposed and indomitable freedom of artistic expression to give us a generous helping of free meat, several fornicios and autofelaciones with Manhattan Fund. None of these Visual licenses helps nothing notable that raise crude in this film desprejuicidado simple, tiresome and, occasionally, tone and I proud of his porn label narrative or intelligent, but hollow, enfangado in a metaphysical drift of balance of cheap, where the character dissected their schizophrenias, they exorcizan their vices and even infringe lubricious contorsionismos so amazing that they don't know one if it attends to a pedl√≠cula or a cabaretero-circense show for seniors, idle and extruding. Everything is by denying inhibition, abolish the modesty, psychoanalyze powders in morning with smooth jazz as playful sound pillow.I do not know yet whether the project is simply dirty or is exotic or film artie hippies resonances. I do not know if this militancy is healthy in the voyeuristic or any aesthetic diversion (I will not say moral) in variegated, vulgar entertainment and kitsch of this plastic universe of individuals tellurically troubled by existential suffocation of sex. Freud catch them.Without being a hodgepodge of film, it is dispensable. Without being absurd, it is obscene. As if to Woody Allen, in a hebreo-burlesca paranoia, it occurred encabritar to their usual morons and put them to ride young girls and boys while the city in the background beats as an unborn baby cast by the jazz.</body>
