	<body>The main interest and reason why I went to see this film, was the trailer reminded me to "Big Wednesday", film of surf par excellence. Thanks to this I have been able to enjoy an interesting proposal, in which Visual effects stand out above all.The story is quite simple, and even a bit absurd, that focuses on the hopes of a young surfer and Championship which has played in few days. As well, this small period of time could have been lengthened until a period more or less consistent with what is intended to (that are ready to win the Championship). However, "Crazy for surfing" has some very attractive characters, in the Spanish version are very well made, especially the chicken, voiced by Alexis Vald√©s. A novelty in this genus, is that the film is told as a television reporting, in which there are interviews, zooms and camera in hand movements troop "realism" to the tape.It will not go down in history as one of the great films of animation, but "Crazy for surfing" will delight children, lovers of surf and accommodating spectators.</body>
