	<body>WES ANDERSON will surely go down in history as one of the most imaginative authors and acids of the recent film, where camouflaged in comedy authentic urban tragedies always under a same cast who understands their ideas by very Martian arising.OWEN WILSON, ANGELICA HUSTON, BILL MURRAY always present in his filmography as unorthodox titles of AQUATIC LIFE or the TENENBAUMS.Add other recognized faces in the pianist BRODY or the much vaunted naked of NATALIE PORTMAN apparently not requiring that they sever it to the delight of fans who stayed with honey on the lips in CLOSER. The husband of Maria Antonieta JASON SCHWARTZMAN also appears.Mr. ANDERSON maintains his imagination intact but completely loses the direction in his humour that shines here by their absence in a real brick where you you spend almost all footage trying to understand the hell wants to count.A few impossible dialogues do not help in an unclassifiable film which causes yawning in the room or that we agree in the mother of the director.I think it is to that was due the suicide attempt of OWEN WILSON, none of drugs or traumatic ruptures, the poor man try to understand the script of his friend being so foolish decision I can understand because I almost cut myself the veins and that I was not obliged to read me the work.Save the brick the magnificent landscapes of india.
