	<summary>Las 13 Rosas is not a masterpiece, but the story is powerful and moves and shakes the heart for the injustice that was committed with these girls.</summary>
	<body>In these times where there is much controversy created and fed by politicians of right-wing, this kind of movies are also victims of these absurd and in polemics. But it is normal to make films about the civil war and the post-war period, which is a part of the history of this country that generated many events and injustices that deserve to be counted, just as there are many films on the Holocaust, because these conflicts are human dramas that are likely to become films.Leaving aside the polemics, this film is not a great work, although the story is powerful and touches and stirs the heart for the injustice that was committed with these girls. Despite being a good story, actors are not at the height, above all the male actors who fail in the voice, giving the feeling in some moments that are reading rather than acting, this makes you leave the history, especially in the beginning.Towards the middle of the film, when the girls are incarcerated, the story becomes more intense and already beginning to peek first tears in anticipation of the tragic end.Actresses generally do a good job stressing above all Marta Etura and Luisa Mart√≠n (remembered for being the family physician Juani). Surprisingly Leticia Sabater makes a small role and does it not hurt.In conclusion, it is not a great film, but tells a story that deserves to be remembered and therefore is not over see it.</body>
