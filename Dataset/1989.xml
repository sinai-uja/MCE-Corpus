	<body>Third parties are hardly good is something that almost everyone certainly believe. That much money is not always synonymous with a good product, the check week Yes and another also on the Bulletin Board of our cinema. That a movie based on a comic book only serves to entertain is an axiom. But is that even trying to justify it, the last film by Sam Reimi can only be defined as a boring and pathetic story that disappoint both the superhero lovers and to those who, without being sympathetic to it, enjoyed with the two previous sagas.No just action and special effects that have been more expensive than Visual, narrative shows a stitch of melodramatic stories that have a clear folletín taste. And do not believe that the director has had some decency and only has amuermado us for ninety minutes, none of it more than two hours of unbearable torture!During the succession of anaesthetic events will appear two new characters based on the original comic (venom and Sandman), however, as happened with the main protagonist (Peter Parker), these rather distanciarán between the paper and the screen.To all this add bizarre transformation Spider-Man who suffers in the hands of the alien: gives listening to Disco music and believe Benny Hill. Amazing, isn't it? In short, nothing short of disastrous. I have warned them.</body>
