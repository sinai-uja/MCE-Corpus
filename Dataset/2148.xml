	<body>Melinda and Melinda is not of the best films of Woody Allen, although the approach is very good, fails to achieve its objective. It could have been a very interesting movie, with two parallel stories, another comedy and a drama, but the problem is that the comedy does not laugh and the drama is not so dramatic, so at the end so there are two stories quite bland and predictable, without any interest.Sometimes not appreciated the difference between two frames, because there is enough humor in the comedy, despite having the comedian Will Ferrel, who is the only one that makes any grace. The drama is not tragic, because the Viewer fails to engage with the protagonist and therefore gives us just what happens.This film showed great promise but is disappointed to realize that there are times in which Woody Allen doesn't know to do comedy, better keep the memory of Match Point, a jewel.</body>
