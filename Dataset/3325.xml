	<body>BEN AFFLECK seemed willing to become one of the worst actors in the history of the cinema. Really disastrous performances in DAREDEVIL or PEARL HARBOR among others, they showed their great lack of charisma and an inability to convey the slightest emotion.Apparently has other quite remarkable qualities, not evil in the work of writer defends himself "Oscar included by the indomitable Will hunting" but it turns out that you hid a huge talent in the direction.After spending the first controversy because the script of the film is modelled to a popular real case which of course this morbid in a great advertising can take advantage. Outside of tabloid scandals, this is one of these debuts soñados by any filmmaker.Perhaps we have one of the best police in recent times, a drama dry narrated with enormous strength, outstanding technically with a script full of surprises and characters are not what they seem at first. A film so murky and full of elegance that transmits the best virtues of classic film noir.Obviously helps some excellent interpreters, since MORGAN FREEMAN Veterans "Still as God" ED HARRIS "The hours" or the younger brother of the director that has much higher than his elder brother interpretative characteristics. Performs double with the also notable the cowardly to mato Jesse james postulating of form is his step to stardom.</body>
