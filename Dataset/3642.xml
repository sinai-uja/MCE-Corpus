	<summary>A fun, entertaining and charming film that tells a story of people like you or like me and let a good taste out of the film.</summary>
	<body>The film begins when Cundo (Javier CÃ¡mara) returns to Asturias after 10 years to attend the funeral of his best friend, Suso. "When plan is to spend a couple of days in the village, getting drunk with his friends from childhood and go by where he had come, but that's not going to be as easy as he thinks: ex girlfriends, ex lovers and parents are loose ends that need a solution and to make matters worse discovers that Suso also had left a case pending so his stay extends far more than I had planned.""La Torre de Suso" is a sometimes bittersweet comedy, but also fun and upbeat, is above all a tribute to friendship. This friendship with capital letters that supports the passage of time, distance, loss and the routine. The friendship that he is able to overcome anything and "survive" even to the death.Best thing about the movie is (apart from Javier camera to see how improves with age!) its simplicity. Without a super eloquent and memorable dialogues is able to get hooked and make you connect in some way with the characters. And it is this simplicity that allows linking a portrait of life in mining communities with a story about feeling lost and not knowing where is heading your life, friendship, drugs or love and give us really unforgettable scenes.Ultimately, there is not a movie that go expecting a super big production with metaphysical dialogues or anything of the sort. It is a fun, entertaining and charming film that tells a story of people like you or like me and let a good taste out of the cinema. so glad to Spanish film support!</body>
