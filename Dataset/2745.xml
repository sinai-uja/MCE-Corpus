	<body>Disappointment in all rule this Dead Silence directed by James Wan, the type that shot the first Saw and here returns to the Viewer as if moron. The only reason why I held my until the end was to confirm that in the 15 minute movie "seen the Duster" and already know absolutely everything, so go bitch friend Wan. A ridiculous scene with a Lord, that I will not spoilear if any reader of debauchery with less than thirteen years wants to see it, says it all.At ridiculous times to most ridiculous moments.And fucking mania of the Wan rolling with his fetish actor Donnie Wahlberg, an authentic gañán.Nor the first ten minutes, which is more acceptable are cool. Wan will have to put aside his facet of scammer if you want to go to see that (a priori) ochentada with Kevin Bacon making Charles Bronson entitled Death Sentence.</body>
