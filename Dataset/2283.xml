	<summary>No one in their right mind can believe nothing of what they say in their 90 min. footage, nobody, I repeat, nobody cares "pepino" what happens, what will happen or what has gone before, indeed of those tapes that they visionan and forget so fast as you view.</summary>
	<body>While a server is biting the nails, waiting to give 21: 00 and began the last League game, which could be (and in the end gave) the League the team of my loves, my wife suffered, which I had all day wearing the shirt of Real Madrid and perhaps as revenge, decided to watch the tape that brings us today; the truth is that, which usually I read, know the "tirri" I have all that comedy romántíca self-respecting and this is no exception, where a more open than the English Court argument on first Sunday of each month, only can save the presence of our beautiful Elena Anaya, the first face that appears in the footage.And it is the tape, once again, peca of all kinds of stereotypes that one can see in any TV movie desktops, starting with the main actor, continuing by Meg Ryan (what noses has there been in the morros?) and ending in Kristen Stewart, whom we met as daughter of Jodie Foster in "Panic room" of David Fincher.Nadie in their right mind could believe nothing of what they say in their 90 min. footage, nobody, I repeat, nobody cares "pepino" what happens, what will happen or what has gone before, indeed of those tapes that they visionan and forget so fast as you view.Anyway, that I did not like anything, and that having the mind set on another site, I became heavy and plumbate.</body>
