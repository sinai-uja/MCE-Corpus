	<summary>Popcorn horror film. Not very scary, but it is not to belittle it as an option in these days of bad horror movies</summary>
	<body>Wow, that more crappy poster made. You would sell more House which develops that the cutrez of this mobile. In addition, reminds me a Japanese film called "missed call" that found me more bad than dog meat.The film is a kangaroo that goes to a house where lost Christ gave the three voices, owned by a wealthy doctor and his wife. Its mission is to care for her two children that night while their friends go to a strange party that burned some editor in the purest style KKK. The House is amazing and is automated completely, including a garden with pond and giant Aviary inside. Suddenly, the phone would ring and no one answers on the other side of the cable. Several calls and finally the voice prompts by the status of children.Well, you what want tell you? The film is apparently a remake, but that gives us equal, given that we see the film as if it were new not for speculating about which is better and which worse. Theoretically is horror, and moments that give something of fear as the end. It is very welcome the way in which was recorded, given that photography has taken care and there are small details that are very well. The dead that appear are where they belong, and more insinuados than anything else. That I liked. History not so much, but hey, that nothing happens. And best of all, the House in which the story unfolds. With the exception that did not live in it although I pay, it seems incredible. Above all the issue of having a greenhouse with pond in the middle of the room.In short, horror of popcorn. Not very scary, but nor is it to belittle it as an option in these days of bad horror movies.</body>
