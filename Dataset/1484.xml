	<body>Watching this movie I was reminded of these new once coupons, that if we look at the movie above, and without scraping we will get the prize, that above it is nothing more than a stupid comedy, where there are only 2 or 3 thank you showing up in the trailer, but. If scraping a bit we find ourselves with a raw and biting critique of society, (more to the USA to the world), where we see a useless President, that can not speak, nor concerned the policy, or you have idea of what is the world in which we live, a depressed and disgusted President who does not know very well that with a post that comes big does sound them of something?On the other hand, we have the television competitions, where people are able to do the most embarrassing of the ridiculous just to have their 15 minutes. of Fame, then this the problem of Islamic terrorism (and in the end they are so Western as us), so that in the end, the film above is shit, but scratching is something else.Original, but not to impact.</body>
