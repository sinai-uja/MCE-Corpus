	<body>While in the morning took me the coffee contemplating an excellent documentary of the Spanish company of special effects DT (1 Oscar for "El Laberinto de el Fauno" winners) and taking advantage of my media naranja had bought (is supposed to me, although she as this enjoying almost more than I) "Star Wars – the legacy" book this opportunity thanks to the half a kilo of edits that Lucas has been publishing for to revisit the series.It is true that sit in front of the TV to see the Star Wars movies is like to see at Christmas that cousin makes while you don't see, and who, enjoy his presence, is that, with the film that gave home to the phenomenon, it is easy to feel identified, although it is the umpteenth time that you see and know of p a pánot only their dialogues, but also many of the secrets (or additions of the version remastered.) of filming of the same.It is true that at the narrative level, history, (have always said that Lucas is a lousy writer.), is quite loose and even predictable, but good, he wanted to make a kind of tribute to the action film, and novels and succeeds, separate, always liked films that revolve around to visit places and do things, and so forth. And Star Wars is one of those films, as its actors, it is true that both Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are great, not so Mark Hammil, which is, quite lost in her role as Luke Skywalker.En anyway, I most add a tape which is a classic in a generation right? Or recommend, or occurs to me, all have seen her a thousand times.</body>
