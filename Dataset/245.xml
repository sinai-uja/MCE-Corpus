	<body>The new proposal for Dreamworks Animation meets the expectations and becomes an entertaining film that will delight children and adults. The argument is very typical, that tells us how RJ, a raccoon, has a time limit to recover food from a bear, if he doesn't want to be devoured by it. And so it embauca to a family of animals that have turtle Verne as visible head, so help him get it, obviously without telling them the truth.At that time unique animals Gawain his world to venture into ours, and so begin to dissect our way of life. The film despite making a critique of our Customs does not remain exclusively in this, and goes to show us their journeys in which will be apparent the importance of values such as loyalty and friendship. An aspect that had me concerned was the dubbing, and say this because despite being regarded our country as one of the best in this field, lately is being fashionable count famous actors to embody the animated characters, and in many cases the result is disastrous. In its original version this invaders patrol is made up of Bruce Willis and Nick Nolte, Garry non Avril Lavigne among others, and our version we are to Michel Brown, Luis Merlo, Isabel Ordaz and Eduardo Soto to cite some.And I say that I was concerned because this time they saved from burning, and seem quite appropriate for the roles. Maybe that the tape with dubbing actors won integers, but this is something that we can not check. The truth is the script to comply, providing the movie actions during plan mission impossible, dialogues and jokes very funny, they manage to hedge us to fresh and very enjoyable. Definitely a good choice for the beginning of summer marked by the world, the beach and the return of Superman.</body>
