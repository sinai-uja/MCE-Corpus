	<summary>So dose of Homer just overwhelming, but one cannot leave satisfied the screening room by seeing their favorite characters on a large screen.</summary>
	<body>The transition to the big screen was something that the Simpsons should have done long ago, and is it already took a series of less successful in having their format on the big screen and was also something that everyone who have followed her sometime expected forward.The transition to cinema has sat well the characters and is the technical Bill in these cases always comes out benefit and the Simpsons are never had seen before, with greater detail and definition, shadow and camera movements that the television format not offered. The film took the opportunity to review of characters and situations already views and any minimum follower of the series and its constant repetition in Antena 3 known. But to have a linear argument misses the opportunity of having done a more choral film and that other characters have more prominence because it makes the problem that just focusing too much on the character of Homer Simpson and leading him to such an extent of committing so many stupid past Raya you just passing and losing part of his grace.Anyway it retains the irreverent humor that has made the famous series, many gags are really fun and while such doses of Homer ends up overwhelming one can not satisfied out of the projection room by seeing their favorite characters on a large screen.</body>
