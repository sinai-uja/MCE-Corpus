	<summary>That gave us the excellent 15 days with you proves that it is a thorough illustrator of cityscapes populated by anonymous beings that represent much of us.</summary>
	<body>Not hard to identify with whom here, simply are not: neither adults nor children, unemployed or workers, students, neither criminals nor honest people. Jesus Ponce has it very clear: is as simple as they are not.The outline is right, camera Latino with the framing but still no, something happens with this tape: it may be the fact that us not be round because of a somewhat linear footage, in the absence of some much needed shift in history, a breath that should come before the 'expected', the events that precipitate the predictable outcome. Still, these already-not-so-young, representatives of an indefinite generation, is there poured a conscientious work to make anything random. No tags nor claims of cementing a cinematic movement which does not exist (though neither would be wrong). About 'Andalusian neorealism' that acuñen others, that Yes, the third proposal of Ponce - the second, if we neglected the work of custom which was Skizo - maintains parallels with a good number of tapes that, curiously, have been filmed in Andalusia and show, nor this is anecdotal, a social reality extrapolated to other boundaries although, believe me, are characteristic of the Sur.Conste tables who subscribes to these words is AndalusianHence there is no decorum in say anything squeaking in what relates Ponce through a chorus of well defined characters. The filmmaker gets as few do sketches, supported by a rigorous, realistic and sensible interpretation, arman the skeleton of a hangover though interesting panoramic view that complete the already drawn by Virgin, also notable as Carlos against the world and 7 titles.</body>
