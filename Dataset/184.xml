	<body>I love vengeance movies, maybe are my favorite. Anyway I will try to be objective even taking into account this comment. Given the number of famous actors who star in this film it is assumed that the Ribbon of the film would be the height. interpretations are generally very good, although it is difficult to believe you to Morgan Freeman making mafia boss.That whole story rests on an actor so doubtful as Josh Harnett is dangerous, but given that the director made him act very convincingly in obsession (Wicker Park) the truth is that it takes him very well over the course of the entire film.(Recounts history as a series of misfortunes catastrophic;) lies on Slevin. the unfortunate young man will go to seek asylum on the floor of a friend which to disappeared from the face of the Earth as if by magic. Following here our protagonist will be involved in a series of conflicts of identity that forced you to perform a murder if you want to pay a deudapendiente that his friend has with "The Chief," a mafia boss who is faced with the rival band led by "The Rabbi". So then the protagonist must go slowly keeping stylish situations more complex to avoid it to unleash a war of bands that put an end to his life.The styling and the way of narrating the film is surprising very beautiful and uses resources very innovative when it comes to telling sub-historias. The only thing and perhaps most disappointing of the film rests on the main motivations of the history and the lack of realism in some scenes that make more than a thriller film look like a tape of action. The soundtrack is quite inappropriate in most times and only works guarantee on a couple of occasions.</body>
