	<summary>Fascinating exercise introspection among the western crespuscular and melodrama... A master work of the film.</summary>
	<body>Road movie: the sun beats the head of Travis, which takes a ridiculous hat and a suit of sad and scruffy Executive. Do not know who he is: like almost everyone. He is alone and fatigue desert stripped of heroism, decommissioned this virile epic that returning from nothing, from hell, to resolve the unknowns that not cleared before the flight. Hell is also the city and ne of your dreams: Travis, a Harry Dean Stanton incomensurable, is an amnesiac John Wayne, a peaceful gunman seeking pin reward in tree, taciturn such, burned for lifetime gross and pathetic, but avoided to find again and gather the threads that it not anudó and are still agitatedoblivious to the biography of its owner, the carcinogenic wind of the desert of Texas. Errático, does not travel by land, not deal with sidewalks and roads, crappy motels of secondary roads and dramatic landscapes that seem not to comfort the vista ever: what makes Travis is go inward, discover in his Stakhanovite journey of citizen pure and fascinated by the uncertainty of not knowing. Or is it that we, seemingly sane and masters of our destiny, we know who we are?Poorly negotiated film except in its final stretch when the words are truly accurate. They speak before, during the journey of Travis to his redemption, images, which are portentous as rarely seen in recent cinema.Around them, as a cloak of serenity, the music by Ry Cooder, a fascinating soundtrack which is matrimonia perfectly with the history of losses and failures, random and forgiveness that Sam Shepherd, an author very unjustly undervalued, adapts that Wenders made his best film. A master work of the film.</body>
