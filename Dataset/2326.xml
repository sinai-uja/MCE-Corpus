	<body>Does much (and that the film has been released for centuries in the rest of the world) I decided to see this (llamemoslo "Biopic" call it somehow), carried out by Gus Van Sant on the alleged last hours of the life of Kurt Cobain, the legendary vocalist of "Nirvana".Say that the film is a horrible is staying short, is supposed to be the last few days in his life, and Van Sant paints Cobain as a curious character dedicated to move one site to another without speaking a word (the script of the film is conspicuous by its absence, and they spend almost 10 min. until we hear the actors to emit any sound)the photography is excellent and the hypnotic (by say something good and be somewhat benevolent) music, the characterization of Michael Pitt is acojonante, that Yes, if to my ponen me a blond peluc√≥n and me leave beard!I am also a Cobain! Well it would require something more, but hey.I do not know as such crappy (after its success at Cannes) has come to premiere at Spain, but if you flee from it.</body>
