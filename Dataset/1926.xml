	<summary>Not too much, because the movie is technically normalita, but their Wicker work and at the end leaves a more than acceptable taste. Nice romantic comedy, no more.</summary>
	<body>Nice comedy, more or less, not seeking more than the complicit in the viewer smile and think that the consigue.aunque cost a little.It is nice to spend the minutes, because the first third is somewhat static, just outlining the smiles and the characters are not yet defined. Somewhat hard to enter history, which seems to be nonsense.However, and this should not be to the credit of the script, little by little the thing takes shape, beginning the smiles and an undoubted mark of elegance and good work.This help a better definition of the gags, both verbal and physical, even those that happen off camera, as the awakening of Drew Barrymore under the piano of Grant. And an achievement is also the undoubted good chemistry between the two absolute protagonists, which may not seem more different, but which are complementary, undoubtedly because their characters are well profiled.Various minor characters, as the sister of the protagonist and her charming husband and, above all, the Manager of the protagonist, making it very well, even without articulate Word, contribute their bit to achieve an entertaining comedy romantic, who can forget altogether soon end the slide show, but it looks like while manages to entertain.Not too much, because the movie is technically normalita, but their Wicker work and at the end leaves a more than acceptable taste.</body>
