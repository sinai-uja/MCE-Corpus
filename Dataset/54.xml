	<summary>Good evening, I'm Johnny Cash</summary>
	<body>Slack the rope on which wanders the film only underpinned by the performances of its main protagonists grandisimas and a music to me personally I love. The biopic are fashionable and if they have much more the life of music legend, raze at the box office and especially in awards, last year was Ray Charles who inundated our screens with good jazz and we also had our own in Spain with shrimp. Now it is up to Cash make us enjoy the best country. Without a doubt the best of the film is the duo protagonist, Joaquin Phoenix, splendid as Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon that brings a sweetness to her character, June Carter, special (the Oscar is yours). There is a brutal chemistry between the two on screen that makes points the film to a clumsy and topical narrative with a perfectly structured script to move and thrill with the rise to fame and subsequent descent into the hell of drugs and the final redemption with the help of his beloved. But the film accomplishes perfectly and has good dose of entertainment, such as concerts with Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy Orbinson? No doubt an entertaining but insufficient film tribute to the Troubadour of the losers, with a custom sound between sad and melancholic sound of country music, the rebellion of rock and folk emotions, an authentic legend of American popular culture. But it could always be worse. "You you wear black that you didn't have another thing to put you, your music is so accidentally, and kiss me you were going to give has been unintentionally." "Once in a while you'd have to give you some merit".</body>
