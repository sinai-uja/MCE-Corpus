	<summary>One of the funniest stronger from the 80's. Entertainment pure and simple that should not asked you large cinematographic expectations.</summary>
	<body>What you say of one of the most crappy but at the same time charming 1980s films? An entertainment of principle to the Chiodo brothers then devoted to the work of special effects for example in films such as Critters without going back to the leadership.We are before a tribute from the films of invasions with teenagers with exceptional makeup especially meritorious by its tiny budget.You of course don't have to take seriously or ask a good achievement as this is an exploitation of the time as only intends to do so have fun.The truth is that it does by far and this I think that you must satisfy the expectations. Performers include the gorgeous Suzzanne Snyder starred "Explosive women" or Grant Gramer that he acted in other serie b "Elves, end of the damn year" ultimately a film for fun as nice without damage.</body>
