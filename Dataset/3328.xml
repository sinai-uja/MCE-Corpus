	<summary>Which could have been the best movie of action of the twenty-first century is a horny divertimento pulp meets Garth Ennis, which is not little.</summary>
	<body>Shoot ' em up could have been one of the best movies of the year. He could have left stranded Bourne (it does not, that was more film) and the rest of movies of action views this season. But fails. And fails because when not Queen of the action, which is frenetic, gamberra, cutting, uninhibited, original, fun and exciting, I'm bored. "The plot" is also one more, nothing gimmicky and rocambolescas diabolic frame server expected despite being badly explained that one hard to get to understand how is it possible to not have understood something of a film as well.Pisses me off because it has aguna absolutely memorable idea which is among the coolest of the year, as the war of neons of the principle, the sex scene or the end next to the fireplace: great moments that you encabronan, because when they are already talking not cool either.Anyway this is a macarrada which seems to shot (or signed) by Garth Ennis and that makes the jungla4.0 still be more horrific.Not to mention the character of Monica Bellucci that, when he speaks in italiano-doblado, says things like Horrore.</body>
