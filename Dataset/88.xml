	<body>Always it has intrigued me much a matter. The original Pink Panther Film dates back to the 1960s, and it already was like a diamond to the Pink Panther. And I wonder, that relationship did the diamond with the cartoon? Since then, the name, and I have to give thanks to the creator of such series, as funny as the Panther after having gotten into the washer and look like a giant pink bubble Imaging. That's nice.The film is about a diamond known as "The Pink Panther", obviously because it is that color. During the celebration of the French football victory over China (World's great power of table tennis), coach and owner of such Boulder is killed and the same, stolen. For reasons which are not the case, the search for the murderer and the jewel is responsible for dumb and clumsy all researchers Paris, Inspector Clouseau.Tiene fair thanks and the necessary touch of sobriety so that a film not embarrassed. I was afraid I find myself with a retaila of facilones, without much grace jokes, that made me want to be anywhere else. But no, pleasant surprise took me to see that the jokes were more or less ingenious and everything was still a logical dash, dotted with the sympathetic inspector incompetences. And clear, if you have the Renó aside, the thing is likely to pretty good movie. And it is that this actor is incredible. It is a comedy which not smile in no time. And look that you have time to smile, but nothing. Notably, dancing sticking (terrific) upholstery and classes of accent of Clouseae, which are somewhat excessive, but they have their point.In short, for a laugh with a comedy of good level. Or if only to see the scandal of the Beyoncé body.</body>
