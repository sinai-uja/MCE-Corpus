	<body>Who I was going to say (no, Bisbal has the patent) that my grandmother might find me a "pretty well" movie?Because in a store lost in that section of dvd which they paid up because they carry, and that nobody wants to find "The right to be born", 1952. Then get a small notice from Outlook in my head saying "film to give".I started to investigate a little before see it and discover that this film is based on a Cuban radioculebrón shocked the country and hooked you in the history of Maria Elena and Reed more family forward, the Mexicans shot a film with Clark Gable at the time, Jorge Mistral, Gloria Marín and a cast that includes a black chacha (of lie)(clear).The overview no longer delusional. Attention, some spoiler: María Elena becomes pregnant of a pimp who doesn't want to take responsibility for the creature. At that time, you have children of maiden supposed a disgrace for the family and obviously for herself, so the head of the family, Junco Rafael, decides to have Alberto but afterwards it tries to kill her. María Elena trusts his maid, Mama Dolores, a black maid who takes the creature in secret and the baby as if it were his own. When the baby grows, it becomes Alberto Limonta, a prestigious doctor that is socially frowned upon for having a black mother. He also reconcomen the doubts of knowing his real parents.And from there there are coincidences and various dramas that turn the film into a historical portrait interesting and obviously amazing for the times in which we are. A SOAP Opera made movie that follows with great interest and which is made with passion.So if this film along with the passion of Christ, can be turned into a perfect double session to certain kinds of people: P</body>
