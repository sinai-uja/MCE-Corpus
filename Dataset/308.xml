	<summary>Bandidas is closer to a movie on a certain scale than to a feature-length film. Mediocre.</summary>
	<body>Sara Sandoval and María Álvarez (Penélope Cruz and Salma Hayek) are two girls from opposing social classes. While the first enjoys all the privileges and leads a quiet and affluent life, the other is the daughter of a humble agricultural pawn. Under normal conditions, prevailing in the nineteenth century social immobility and rigidity, these two girls have never engaged in friendship; but when a few mercenaries murder the families of both and steal their land for handing them over to a few greedy and greedy businessmen, have just been reunited and fighting together in pursuit of a vendetta that it eventually turn them into atracadoras and prófugas of justice. Directed by Joachim Roenning (producer of the three burials of MILTIADES Estrada and Transporter 2) and Espen Sandberg, Bandidas is a half of the Western film and half comedy, but precisely because of this duality will not just be nothing in particular. Penelope Cruz, however much that put it in lists of glamorous or favorite of the public, is an actress that exceptions, has not done anything to have the popularity and the cache which enjoys; It is extremely deadpan, poor records and artificial in the interpretation. Salma Hayek sins otherwise than our compatriot: is too exaggerated in the gesture, full of unnecessary fuss. Unfair would be not to mention the more than correct interpretation of Sam Shepard, jutting from the mediocrity. Its main writer Luc Besson has demonstrated on other occasions that it is capable of doing rather better, and broadly Bandidas is closer to a movie on a certain scale than to a feature-length film. Mediocre.</body>
