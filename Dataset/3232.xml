	<summary>Hard as a rock and cruel as the news. Palm return to hell and everything remains the same.</summary>
	<body>Redacted is 2.0 iron hearts. It is based on real events and tells how American soldiers raped a 15 year-old girl in Iraq killed his family and then burned his body. It is not a comedy, no.The director of works so fascinating and captivating as the ghost of paradise or Carrie gives a return of nut to the approach of the film in Viet Nam to continue showing the world rotten in which we live, where seems to be no room for sanity, dignity and humanity through a speech in common with many of the titles seen in the edition of Sitges40the live news camera. In addition to Palm shows news, websites and newspapers of hand of the peloton, forming a narrative set as experimental as fascinating and disturbing. As Viet Nam Eriksson (that poignant Michael J Fox departed for his roles as "niñato") will be here another soldier with remorse that will uncover the scandal, McCoy, that as in the other film resulting Ripper with a final speech that makes goose bumps.If we didn't have enough with the recreation of the assumptions made the director ends the movie with a real photo gallery saved for the end a frightening image which causes the viewer suffers more than the account and leave the cinema with an idea too clear what happened. Courageous and provocative, as in the good old days.</body>
