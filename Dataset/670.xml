	<body>Adaptation to the big screen in the series "Miami Vice", where the only link between this and the film that runs one of the producers of the same, Michael Mann, lies only in the title and in the name of the protagonists (Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx in its fair measure), the tape is lost between a quite normal argumenta setting which reminds "Collateral" and "Heat", and a photo and a luminosity opaque and quite dark.Michael Mann, has been able to accompany the Ribbon, a noisy soundtrack, by what this current cinema mania? where only musical references to that style 1980s MTV, is a home of the main theme (chords only), and the theme of Phill Collins that closes it.On the other hand, descataría to side 2 of luxury of the film, on the one hand, Luis Tosar, as the bad guy movie (it Mania has given Hollywood to us as the bad), and on the other side to Gong Li, which we enjoy in "Memoirs of a Geisha", as the vase woman that accompanies the protagonists.Film action, well planned and well shot although it is intended to accompany a, already cult series for those who we rondamos the thirty, little, not to say nothing, has to do with the original.</body>
