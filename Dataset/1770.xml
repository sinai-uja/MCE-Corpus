	<body>The River King is not a horror film. The River King is a film that perfectly could throw a summer in Antena3 Saturday afternoon. The River King is entertaining. The River King should be a television series. The River King reminds me Maleficio.Con these 5 statements define what is and what has seemed The River King.No is a horror film, but you try to pretend this whole issue of stains of the photographs with the appearances of the child in the snow. It is not a bad film (hence the 5), but is not simply in the adopted (hence 0.5 added).It is entertaining (though sometimes end with the patience of the Viewer).As for my statement that should be a television series. the truth would be a highly entertaining series. It reminds me of an American haunting. Although The River King I liked more than spell, or at least have found me more enjoyable, longer than the other it sank in a myriad of paranoia that ended with my patience. But I have to say that the issue of mixing the paranoia of the protagonists with the main plot of the film led him better spell to The River King, which seems to solve everything at the last minute because he has gone over time and not know how to get rid of all the issue of visions of the protagonist.Everything in the film is correct, except for the script. Those gaps that leave the visions of the protagonist, the subject of the photographs. everything that makes you think the movie is something "supernatural" annoys the function (and sometimes much). The funny thing is that it is based on a novel (do?), is that the explanation for the bad cohesion of the elements? Not what is.It is an entertaining film. But not worth spending the money on it.</body>
