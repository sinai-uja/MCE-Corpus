	<body>What a joke of a movie. It is not that you do not hold or not it makes sense, it is posed I Know Who Killed Me is so shameful that when explained it at the end of the tape gives embarrassed.Lindsey Lohan plays on this occasion a typical young American: popular, pretty, talented and promising that it is suddenly kidnapped. When it appears half dead in a ditch is believed to be another person, a stripper's dark past. The police should do the recall because it is the only person who has escaped from captivity and the only clue to achieve capture the murderer is already recidivist in kidnapping and mutilation of other girls in the area.Yes, okay, we have seen it at other times, put some example saved with some commercial dignity for the collector of lovers, but what gives us this pseudo paranormal drama is more than anything else ridiculous. Not only the script da pena, in addition his poor performances are the perfect companion to accompany the fall of its leading young actress, probably chose the project under the influence of any psychoactive.Although end to start the year I dare to presage that it is going to be the worst tape ahead with a quality that almost no late to average telefilm.</body>
