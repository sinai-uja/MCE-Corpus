	<body>Entertaining film, ideal to watch on Saturday afternoon at home after stand food which fattened pigs. Witty but predictable story that there is nothing special that stands out.Edward Norton (fight club) comes packed with magnetism and charisma, next to a Jessica Biel (3 Blade) which I love but I see that it has suffered the syndrome of the copy. And what is this? because that this actress is a triangles and has artistic personality to spare, made him the slaughter of characterizing it as Scarlett Johanson, if you look in the hair, the makeup, the expressions are a copy of the aforementioned actress. Even I would say that you there are approximately 4 CC of extra Hydrogel on his upper lip to accentuate even further the resemblance. And why is this? Does Scarlett refused this role?, or perhaps the culprit is the new film by Hugh Jackman (Wolverine, X-Men), which bears some similarities to "The magician", time will tell.In any case is a film that I expected something more?</body>
