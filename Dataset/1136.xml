	<body>The question may be: will you expect or you do not expect an end like this? If you expected is that you're a very smart guy. And not to mention if you expected from the outset: a genius. Since they stopped publishing the magazine "Kabbalah", people need movies like this to say the list is.I'm not ready, I do not know much of geometry, nor much of history, as the Sam Cooke song, but there are characters that I fall well. The character of Hugh Jackman I liked when I wanted to return the insult. It was interesting when it becomes the only thread that moves his life rivalry. It is then lost.The problem of these directors as brain as Nolan is that they put the history in the service of an idea of a trick. Posts to choose, I prefer the trick of "The illusionist" which is at the service of the story. And I also liked much "the illusionist". The only thing I can say in favour of Nolan is known to tell a complicated story. It is a story in three times that hide a surprise, and however does not lose the Viewer.Michael Caine's character is that of the wise, he guided the Magi and explains what is the prestige. It is the third part of the trick, which returns the magic to the reality, which makes it again appear sanity. The Prestige is the part that lacks to the film.</body>
