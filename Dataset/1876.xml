	<summary>Another turn of the screw more to a story than little more than Yes can give now. A movie for fans of the Cannibal, but little else.</summary>
	<body>Some years ago, large studies found a new way for huge profit using as I call a great success for a decade or two earlier. If until then old sequelae of these profitable productions, suddenly to someone came up the idea of creating films located in a time prior to the original, rather than the usual continuation of the primeval history. Prequel was the name that received these films, which reached its greatest levels of expectation with the premiere of the first three chapters of Star Wars.Diez years later we got a disastrous second part of the premiere of the silence of the lambs, Hannibal, and just a year later the first prequel of the series, the Red Dragon, which reached an acceptable success among critics and public. Hannibal, the origin of evil recreates the childhood of Hannibal Lecter, and aims to delve into the facts that made him a bloodthirsty killer. Among the most notable changes in this latest installment, highlights the fact that Anthony Hopkins, something logical if we consider that what tells us this time is the childhood and youth of the character does not appear for the first time. The film goes from more to less, starting from a beginning full of force that is yielding to a somewhat weary rhythm that ends with get it is a little long. In general, it seems that rather than explain it is to justify the subsequent conduct of the psychopath, pretending to create emotional ties with the criminal in the Viewer. Neither interpretation nor any technical aspect are not very notable. A movie for fans of the Cannibal, but little else.</body>
