	<body>"The harvest of ice", Harold Ramis, is a film failed in all and each one of its aspects.Narrates in forzadísima way the blow given, although it never look, a picapleitos buddy of the mafia, Charlie Arglist (Cusack) and his friend, Vic Cavanaugh (Thornton) at the expense of the capo of Kansas City.El script weakens on all four sides, the actors passed through there, the story is boring, predictable and stupid, and is headed by someone who does not know to shoot a "film noir"leaving in the air what could have been done with this story Bryan Singer, or Christopher Nolan.Ramis has proven to be a good director of comedy with his debut "The club of the crackpots", or the adventures of Chevy Chase and his family and it has been shown that if it sounds the flute, you can also direct master comedies, such as the glorious "Trapped in time"in 1993.El script, it seems impossible, it is Robert Benton, featuring fantastic stories in his belt, as "Bonnie & Cyde", "Superman" or the more recent "A hair of silly" or "the falling Sun", but there is no where catch it.The characters have no relationship, we do not have the remotest idea of whether they are friends, acquaintances, from when it trapichean together or when is it lie with their wives without the other knows as spectators.Echoes of the Coens, especially of "Easy blood" or "Fargo", but in a desperate attempt to "it" was recognized and play in the same Division.What you should not know Ramis, apparently, is the only one that has played in that Division and has conquered a title was huge Sam Raimi with its huge "A simple plan", in par 1998.Un of flat beautiful, an emotional moment with Christmas gifts (the action takes place on Christmas Eve) and one or two jokes are very little background for a movie with this casting and this photograph (get the viewer has cold) of Alar Kivilo, interestingly, was the man behind the light of "A simple plan".That's funny, right?. A phrase: "You're dead, not you pretend you're not".</body>
