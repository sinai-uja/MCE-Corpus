	<body>In his brief but successful filmography, Pixar has achieved a complex balance between the animated nostalgia and new techniques by computer. That is, first of all, where paradoxically fails based his most ambitious film and adult, Cars. Probably for being unable to reconcile in a common point the overwhelming invoice visual of their careers, twists and loops with the single, not simplistic, design production of his charismatic characters. An obvious error for a film that, in fact, seems ashamed of herself because you cannot find or do not want to find, an only argument that defends speech that so vehemently proposes: the nostalgic look at the street mother of America, already not only remember, but also recover the way of life that involved the mythical route 66Cars is thereforean indulgent film fails to sublimate their initial material which but, on the other hand, pulls catalogue Pixar; IE representative characters, double readings and height gags scattered so desarticulada as excessive plot. Cars, that manages to shine intermittently, is placed on the edge of the cartoon and only happens to resort to his impeccable visual pyrotechnics to disguise their flaws, but unfortunately rather it underscores them.</body>
