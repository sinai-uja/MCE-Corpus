	<body>This film's cast of bells with pretensions of film of mystery (HA!), is the worst thing that happened by my DVD player. without grace, without storyline set, with eight thousand plots open, flat, stupid, incoherent, characters with thematic poor, uncomfortable, and blatant advertising with disparate lines of dialogue, with Rossy de Palma. It is that you can not get worse!All salvageable is, without doubt, Milo or ' Brannigan, the character played by Stephen Rea, a photographer sobrado, bastard, unscrupulous, cold blood, last thread, but more so than a Saint. To appear on stage brings some interest, a certain curiosity, go, entertaining, because the rest of the film, not even that.</body>
