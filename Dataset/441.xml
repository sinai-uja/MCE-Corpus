	<body>"Hard Candy", the David Slade length debut was for masterpiece but stays halfway due to last half an hour in which give too many rodeos without a specific address, wasting one of the best in recent years. Jeff Kohlver is a photographer of thirty-two years takes a time fools on the network with a girl of fourteen, Hayley Stark. The day of your appointment begins a nightmare of physical and psychological torture that will end in tragedy.Endure with only two actors during more than 90 minutes is a very complicated task Slade resolves masterfully with two memorable concerts conducted by Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page. The camera almost always in close-up, lets see just enough and photography Jo Willems is thick and is sometimes videoclipera, but get plenty of bad environment. Supported in a brief appearance of Sandra Oh, seen in "Between glasses", and the unknown Odessa Rae (excluding a waiter coming out at the beginning), two actors are in a memorable way his duel unless the Director you are Manus the last third, in which isn't at the height of the circumstances, rushing in all the final turns and leaving a sweet and sour taste to the most demanding Viewer. Anyway, "Hard Candy" is an experience that can be enjoyed from beginning to end, a descent into the underworld of the interior who whips the morale and entertains a gray afternoon. A 7.</body>
