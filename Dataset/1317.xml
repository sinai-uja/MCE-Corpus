	<body>Many not will agree with me, but in my opinion DiCaprio (infiltrators) returning to regain the credibility that you cost get, and that he lost so fast in some of his previous films, the quality of his work in this film, is merely indisputable, as already comes to us lately accustomed screen full without giving a single glimmer in which we can doubt on their interpretation in this great movie in which Edward Zwick (the last) (Samurai), has wanted to tell us the events that have taken place in Sierra Leone at the end of the last century during the civil war that there was fought, with diamond mines as a backdrop.Hard film where they exist, in which apart from categorized by age, should also do so by the strength of our stomachs, at least as I see the shock of seeing a child brandish a weapon using it with more hatred and sanguinolencia that if a trained killer is involved, without disdain with the tranquility that are maiming they arms and be silent lives during a good part of the projection. Apart from trying to make us open our eyes to suffering and dubious origin of a large percentage of these precious stones, the film is also give a cry of alarm to the dormant Western minds of the abandonment to which they are subjected some regions of sub-Saharan Africa, and the problems that have led to a vast country in wealth, famine and despair as a result of the fraudulent exploitation of them.It is a constant film, which does not suffer at any time of ups and downs and that there is no room for boredom, not is really if it could make any differentiation in terms of the work of the three main actors, Djimon Hounsou (the island) and makes a splendid and completely credible, work in which Solomon Vandy, a desperate father gives lifehe struggles to find his family having been this section of it by the guerrillas, with the help of a diamond dealer and a journalist, played by the winner of an Oscar of the Academy Jennifer Connelly (Little Children), which disappointed nor at any time, despite the poor appearance of his character.In short, it is a film which cannot see, the reasons I alegaré are so simple as that I can not hide my favouritism towards the career of what I think is a great actor who still has much to show (talk about DiCaprio, and if not give it time to time), is a weight tape and high quality, and shows us what not tells us nobody when these things happen in real time.</body>
