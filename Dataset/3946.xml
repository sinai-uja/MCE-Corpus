	<summary>A final touching al gore, a film very badly shot, technically curious but neglected in his argument is even unpleasant.</summary>
	<body>Corrupt TITO CHINCHAN one of the most prominent critics of much film reminded me of this film that I was not remembering. It is morning down to the dusty attic where I still keep a very dusty VHS collection and discover to my happiness the eyelet is located therein.JESUS FRANCO and LINA ROMAY is one of the most horny couples of Spanish cinema, the most prolific director I worked with his muse in many occasions from the tomb of the living dead or sex is insane also to produce him and working on various aspects in the own fantasies of Lina who directed above all pornography.A woodpecker for three or the chuponas leave no doubt of the arguments, certainly the most bizarre of all is this talkative asshole that leaves you completely speechless before such occurrence, proving that adult film of the era had an imagination far above the current. Of course the filming is terrible, penetrations or see and note the hand of JESUS with fucking Mania to get the ZOOM to each scene.A final touching Al GORE, a film very badly shot, technically curious but neglected in his argument is even unpleasant.</body>
