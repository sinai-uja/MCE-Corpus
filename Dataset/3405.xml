	<body>I have to admit that you for my "Return of the Jedi" is one of those movies that I have a singular affection rather than the own Star Wars freak (which also) because it was the first film in the series vi accompanied by my father at the tender age of 6, a peque√±ajo. See these ships and that accompanied by excellent music by John Williams deep space left in my a big footprint as film buff and a fan of Star wars.Today I wanted to reconnect with all my favorite characters in the series and Episode VI to my best with the "Empire strikes back".The image and sound quality makes you look like watching a new film, perhaps best voices in you in Spanish, where the voice if you have some "old" sound, and it is a pleasure to the eye see Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and company as if it were yesterday.They have added certain images to my taste rather spoil the movie, but well, it must go with the times and find the taste of Luca$ films are their own and do what pleases real.Well, I know we all have seen this film, so to spare the usual recommendations.</body>
