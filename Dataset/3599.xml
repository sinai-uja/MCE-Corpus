	<body>What a nice bees!It seems in the us are very excited because Seindfield has become, albeit Crumhorn insect-shaped. I understand that his sitcom has marked a before and an after American humor but really who appreciate its sordid humor in this film is highly complicated. If the difference key of Bee Movie with the rest of the children's movies of the season it is his humor is funny and intelligent but as it comes signed by Dreamworks isn't highly innovative. And the signing of Seindfield is, is sensed and it tasted but it isn't much less of a return of the great comedian. That it is possibly the best animation film in the last ten years. (I am a fan of Toy Story and I will not get the donkey still)I, abejil crisis, i.e., choose a job, make your life, don't stop or a minute, makes decisions, is helpful,... I think Barry an icon of modernity and intelligence. Just the University and you should choose a job "for life" so before doing so he decides to give a getaway to the real world breaking one of the rules of the bees: not to mention human, his friendship with Vanesa draws two basic conclusions, humans may have good heart and human steal them their honey. The sweat of his brow to go to go to Ray Liotta is undoubtedly something very outrageous for any humans so it must be to commit suicide in a tiny flying bug.So Barry decides to take legal action to restore production and honey to their legitimate owners.Bee Movie is fun, enjoyable, nice and very intelligent. You laugh, seeing the animation of recent years is much longer. So if there is need to get the little ones and you do not want to take a NAP is the best option. And if you're a fan of the animated film will pass to the list of essential.</body>
