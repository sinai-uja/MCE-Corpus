	<body>The man of the time with Grizzly Man, The squid and the whale and the hills have eyes form part of my 2006 selection. The picture is spectacular, as well as the use of the Scope and the city of Chicago, a character more.Cage is spectacular and Mr. Caine and his tone of voice are more rewarding this year (attention to when listening to the song in the car) justified well because it has been a failure in its country of origin; It is one of the films of the year.Beautiful, funny, cruel, sincere. everything is almost perfect in this farcical tale of a man who tries to regain his dignity eneste (evil) world in which we live. It seems impossible that it comes from the same of "The ring" "The Mexican" or "Pirates of the Caribbean".The dysfunctional family seen in film that most resembles the father of family. Best film by Verbinski (probably his masterpiece), who walks with ease by the fine wire that separates the Tenenbaum Happiness. Anthology (and very Kaufmaniano) the journey in search of sauce Tartar and very interesting theory of fast food. Impressive recital of the cast. Another outstanding. 9.</body>
