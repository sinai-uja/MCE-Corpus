	<body>Warning to all my readers, not going to the cinema to see this film, which is a giant truño. Warned quedais. Alone in the dark comes, the title of a game which was released for the PC makes a pile of years. It was an absolute novelty, as well as a revolution. He had a good script, three-dimensional graphics and a camera system that was the cane. Because this film only resembles the game name.The film is a man who lived a few strange experiments during his childhood in the horfanato, until he suffered an electric shock, instead of materle as it should be, gave birth the monstrosity of this film. Years later, tell us that they are following the search of artifacts left by an ancient pre-americana civilization (when this was a pangea, more or less) who had contacted other worlds and not be that more pods. Total, then leave some bugs that eat humans, and they defend and die explodes everything and ends and your breathe. But then follows and you want to cut the veins, and when it seems that you have not completed, will and ends. Incredible. that you want tell you more? Special efectillos script and action without ton are neither. Tontísimos actors who act without any coherence. And worst of all, beyond of the Dantesque end, is the sex scene. Who fucks with the shorts? That woman does it with bra? We will man, give joy to life, no matter you take hiperviolentas scenes of death and destruction but not sacais "chicha".</body>
