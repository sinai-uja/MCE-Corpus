	<summary>The metacine is something very funny. An example of a modern masterpiece. Noir comedy of the good and partner for the story.</summary>
	<body>Kiss kiss bang bang, written and directed by Shane Black, is the thriller faster, fun and original of recent years.In fact, I think that it is the best thriller I've seen from A "Fargo" sausage got actor, (Downey Jr.) in a boot that is enjoyed, he gets into a detective mess that accompanies a detective gay (Kilmer) and a friend of childhood (Michelle Monaghan) that is reunited in the city of dreams.The director is responsible for the scripts of the series "Lethal weapon" or "The last boy scout" (also a movie of our childhood, "An amazing gang" and "The last action hero"), and I have to take my hat at the outcome of his directorial debut, of master results.Photography is excellent, the score is pure noir, the pace is wild and the players are simply sublime.Kilmer is not a great actor, but here enjoying each one of his (ingenious) lines of dialogue, and it shows.Special mention for an extraordinary (as usual) Robert Downey Jr., showing that it is an ACTORAZO the best role of her career. (Yes, better than "Chaplin")I am sure that if the direction drive conducted by Jonze, Gondry or some other modernillo are her qualify masterpiece, because it plays with fiction and reality during all the footage to finish in an autoparódico (spectacular) climax that leaves in its infancy to the of the (notable) masterpiece of Spike Jonze, "Adaptation" absolutely compulsory for all the stragglers.</body>
