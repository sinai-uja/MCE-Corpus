	<body>Robert Rodriguez is a director that I like, but in "Planet Terror" suffers from doing what pleases, commemorating all the films of series b and z that has grown, and of course, is is very fan or the new proposal from the director of "Sin City" becomes quite tasteless and boring moments.And I say this because what fails is the story. Zombies, beautiful girls, military, typical southerners touch Carpenter, Bruce Willis, Rose McCowan. they are sufficient to make it attractive to any movie, but if the argument is as simple as this, the result is something that does not reach you meet."Without a doubt, best of all is the false (not so false at the moment) trailer for"Machete", which is the only one that has survived the massacre made by separating the two films comprising"Grindhouse", and which included a large amount of fake trailers in between both films.""Planet Terror" has fun moments and they stand out clearly as the "ellipsis" which leaves us without knowing which is the past of El Wray, and the reason for his skill with weapons. It also has the value of rescue and count with legendary players such as Josh Brolin ("Thrashin", "The Goonies") or Michael Parks among others, but even so, this seems to me enough to equate this work with some of its earlier proposals. Ultimately, Rodríguez encandilará b and z to all lovers of movies but will leave somewhat puzzled to those closest to the current cinema, and it will be loathed by the vast majority of most commercial viewers.</body>
