	<body>For a long time that a film of this genre did not cause me such an impression so that my body was revolviese against the seat, as a child would do with his mother in search of protection. Specifically, the last time that pass as "evil" was seeing the masterpiece of Amenábar, the others. By the way, anyone be confused, although the titles are similar, the stories do not seem to anything.Fleeing from the clichés that often accompany these films and learning from the classics, the two directors (David Moreau and Xavier Palud) have a good product, emphasizing an exquisite use of the camera and the silences.Actors (Olivia Bonamy and Michael Cohën) we shall transmit a long night of anguish that shall come to pass in some appropriate scenarios where coexist of doubt, the terror and the instinct of survival. We are sure that there will be who, after seeing this movie, feel not so secure in your own home.</body>
