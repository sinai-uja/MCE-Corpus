	<body>Exploitation film vengeance is one of the most recurrent themes, that of female revenge plays an important role in films as desquiciantes as the violence of the sex or COLT 45.Uno of my favorite films of you're characteristics and apparently also of director TARANTINO is THRILLER A CRUEL PICTURE, Swedish production with interpreters that they came directly from the porn and a single director known for being an Assistant to the great INGMAR BERGMAN in a couple of productions.TARANTINO is blatantly inspired to KILL BILL in is the b series, a true jewel of the GRINDHOUSE with all its elements. I.e. violence, sex explicit, martial arts, in a universe full of dirt.The violence of is production is completely dry without artifice or half-hearted, pure evil in all the characters, with moments of pure adrenaline.Maybe the best film of the sub-genre of female vengeance, with an excellent completion, master performances, excellent photography. A masterpiece of the most stark subcine.</body>
