	<body>Pretentious presumably modern tape that baby, without complexes, American cinema, of the ads of Ikea and other European films as the Amenabar. Latter recognized it and its directors during the presentation premiered in Sitges. I know they try out there sell as the new Swedish Matrix, but don't be fooled, the special effects do not go beyond a chapter of "Charmed" and the only thing in common to the Saga of the Wachowski is the leather suit of the protagonist and a pair of dark glasses of itinerant market.Without wishing to dwell, say that the tape is a cochambroso pupurrí of scenes and very recognizable clichés of other films. It is artificial, the pace is a real disaster, there is a single credible or interesting moment and it is supremely boring. It is the movies that are not understood, but not for being intelligent and complex, but the lack of creative coherence, the lack of rigour, talent and be everything that also teaches so fatally shown and developed. A torture.</body>
