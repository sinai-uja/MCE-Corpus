	<body>"Manuale d'amore" was a nice and original Italian romantic comedy, where with love as a thread of the plot, actors (all unknown) we took their land; This film was one success both in Italy outside of the land of calcium, so was more than normal a sequel, the problem, is that you lose the freshness of the previous and this time, to have actors known (in addition to some of the previous ones which also repeated in this) loses the credibility of the previous and the freshness, and attempts to loop the loop.This time, has little to do with love, except for the history of the Gay couple, the rest carried more sex (manuale d' sex it could have called the tape perfectly), and the comedy of entanglement, which translate what in the first movie were parts of love, and the heartbreak.On the other hand there to highlight both the beautiful and sensual Monica Bellucci, a sexual for many and our Spanish Elsa Pataki myth, another sexual myth both uninterrupted on screen although they said not a Word, the rest of the actors I stay with the splendid Carlo Verdone which already repeated the first delivery and also "relay" Sergio Rubini, who in the first delivery was the best of the film.Finally, a sequel without being more of the same, is the same but without more.</body>
