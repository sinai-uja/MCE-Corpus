	<body>I have never liked "real image" in Disney films, perhaps, exceptions such as "Mary Poppins", "My friend the fant√°sma" or "Herbie" always I have bored as an Oyster, to the other side of the Moon from Mickey Mouse, so when last Friday, my wife began to see this film, I, revolcado on the couchas a result of a gastronteritis, the only thing I did was change slightly on side, listening, meditanto and almost contemplating the last round pot of Disney; already we have the typical Teen film, accompanied by a soundtrack glib, which hopes to sell (and that it will sell) discs and more discs, and where actors, chavalitos cut by the same pattern of Justin Timberlake or Hillary Duff, take part of the singer voice (never better said) of the plot, calcada sometimes Grease (a which fails or to the bottom of the shoes), or West Side Story (ahem), and intends to keep the kids glued to the screen.Anyway, I'm not an expert on music, just would like to say that I did not like, it bored me greatly and I prefer me you chop a bee have to swallow this kind of movies.</body>
