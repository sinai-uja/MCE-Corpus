	<summary>We have a sweet comedy that, the issue of the gay goes on tiptoe and stays in a pair of successful jokes and a plot seen thousand times, although there are who can see and laugh a while, does not have to be black or white in this world.</summary>
	<body>I must admit a unique predilection towards Adam Sandler, and it is that, this muchachote always plays more or less the same role, and is accompanied by all their buddies cameos in tapes, I like especially well, and I just always falling (though gripe) in this type of film.On the other hand have Kevin James, perhaps the best of this romantic comedy starring Will Smith and Eva Mendes (talk about "Hitch" to the confused), that got put in his pocket to everyone in his role of clumsy in love with the gorgeous Amber Valletta.Es true, and not deny it, that the film seems quite contrary to what is, and in the times in which we are, is not very politically correct to stop the issue of the Gay movement by the lining, jokes or jokes in bad taste (the SOAP Tablet is very view.), on the other hand, the film has the one, its 2 or 3 fun points (which I imagine will be the trailer that I have not seen), and that with an argument already seen earlier in infinity of comedies (now a boat soon come to mind at least 2 or 3 films with a similar plot), manages, not only boot these smiles I have already said, but leave in addition a semi-agradable taste.I have to say that it is not that I have loved; but it is not that I have offended or annoyed at all the proposal, in addition, enjoy the beautiful and the body of Jessica Biel, well deserves almost 2 hours of footage?In the band sound to highlight from subjects of Queen, until George Michael, in addition to the presence of another gay quintessential symbol, speak of Richard Chamberlain.Resumiendo, I do not want to spend in extension: is a sweet comedy, passing on tiptoe the homosexual theme and is in a couple of successful jokes and a plot seen thousand timesAlthough there are who can see and laugh a while, does not have to be black or white in this world.</body>
