	<body>Would we be talking about one of the best films year-round, if not because one of their actions (splits into three, highly visible) is absolute rubbish and a lack of respect for the patience of the spectator, who has to pay the grandiloquence of a director that has given an attack of egocentric inspiration. I'm talking about the endless Act that takes place during World War II (which includes, of course, that flat sequence that, Yes, Dear Joe, is a prodigy of the technique, the address and all what you want, but which is UNNECESSARY), and is tedious and boring to say enough is enough, breaking with the fabulous rhythm which until then was carrying the film. The pace again, but late. In addition, after the ordeal, the end that has known to joke. Mmmm, isn't me not like the end, on the contrary, I love: but if the film does not fail miserably in the second act the end would be less. "offensive".The cast is not bad, although there is a significant lack of chemistry between a flojita Keira Knightley (thank God that her have not nominated for an Oscar) and a correct James McAvoy. The best without a doubt is Saoirse Ronan, nominadísima best supporting actress, which is out of the screen and eats all veteran performers with potatoes and fried eggs. The soundtrack is certainly a gift from heaven, and a breath of fresh air in the film's weakest moments.</body>
