	<body>PHILIP RIDLEY is not a famous director, or moderately popular, has no awards, his filmography is very low because only has three films and some scripts.The last, the interesting "the passion of DARKLY NOON" where returned to tell the skin that shines with the great actor VIGGO MORTENSEN left a few years to achieve fame with the Rings trilogy.Let's talk about this masterpiece certainly turns out to be skin that shines one of the films most beautiful and sometimes cruel and seeing.Under the vision of a child tell cruel events in a village in the 1950s, a time portrayed to perfection. Abuse of minors, suicide, madness, animal abuse, murders. The awakening of the innocence of a fragile soul haunted by evil of the adults around him, with drops of horror film diverting to vampirism but without a drop of blood is a direct blow to the jaw of the Viewer to the accumulation of misfortunes that surround the child in a desperate world cannot be understood.At the end do not know if cry or shout, the hardness lets you senseless with that strange in its atmosphere beauty, picture master where can dream about playing fields that are flooding the screen.
