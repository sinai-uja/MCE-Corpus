	<body>Spielberg is in a stage of intellectual maturity and I think you want to reflect through science fiction. After the insufferable hodgepodge of Artificial Intelligence and the magnificent Minority Report it is the turn to a science film catastrophic fiction. If the first raised the possibility of sentiment in robots, the second reflected how to improve our security with a prediction system almost infallible (although the movie is totally reactionary), in this third speech of our extermination. Come on, what would happen if the cousins of E.T. were bad and we want to kill everyone.Stating that it seems a wonderful idea recover a history of this style and bring it to the big screen again (still have not seen the 1953 version). Although it is a revision of a classic novel is a great both have gotten this project because it is original.It is a film exceptionally entertaining, memorable sequences and stylish Spielberg (another author). Tom Cruise is as always (see I don't do valuations) and Dakota Fanning (also wonderful) but in a more repellent role in Man on fire, and care, already second in the closing credits. John Williams is for commitment (only makes matters incidental, without any leit - motive recognizable) and even would have been more effective without music. It is a film that does not give a truce and with whom you spend wonderful. As always Spielberg blows a little lime (some cruelty) and sand (frames too "potitas" resolutions).</body>
