	<body>For a super hero live without enemies, without bad bad, is a real shit. And that is exactly what he was going to "Toxie", our hero protagonist son of climate change and the sub industrial products. Become bedel of an institution for the blind to his beloved city "Tromaville", our little graceful protagonist needed psychoanalyst to continue with their day to day. The destination as well, but is bad very bad again try to implant his empire of pollutant terror in "Tromaville", but, as the experience is a degree, know that with "Toxie" in the city have the lose, so that, taking advantage of our hero is rather short, not to say openly asshole, make believe by dastardly tricks, that his father is in TokyoCity where will depart our palurdo and carcinogenic colleague, along with his MOP inseparable, to find his "father". So is "Toxic Avenger 2" (El Vengador Toxico 2), Lloyd Kaufman and Michael Herz film in 1989, sequel to eponymous film of great impact. Surprisingly, entrance, trying to shit movie without pretensions beyond messing frykandeliko, equipped with a few resources nothing despicable. At times fun by the delusional at times boring and undeniably absurd, this film is a classic, along with the entire saga, which, without offering anything new or interesting, has become by popular acclaim in one of those titles venerated for the lovers of beer fattening.</body>
