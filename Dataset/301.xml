	<body>I think that the first film of this genre was Karate Kid. Yes, but true. At that, a chaval√≠n reaches a place unknown to him and falls in love with the wrong girl. It swivels the lomo chulito of the place, but our Kid perseveres in the effort until a fair match gives a beating (as well as a lesson about life). Because these cars are the same, with the exception that the protagonist no longer a timorous character, if not the more cool in his neighborhood.The film is a minor (of hairs in shave to knife and eggs which no longer meet the 30) who is arrested for the umpteenth time in United States by making illegal races. His mother, to avoid the thing happens to older sends to Tokyo with her father, marine profession. There he meets girl who likes, coincidentally is the sister of a mobster who wins in a race but he perseveres until the final tontada in which all are is your place. Another one of the genre.Buff, what you want I say a film whose Rodeo translation would be To PETA and rabid, stalling in Tokyo? For that, a film of car that skid, which tunean and which is laugh at the authority. It adds something new? No. does something to make worthy of going to see it? No, with the exception of the scenes of driving to the limit (as you see drifting 100 the following become cansinas). So little more I can say, that comes out Vin Diesel the last two minutes to leave the faithful with honey on the lips.In short, a hodgepodge of racing and tuned cars that are stalling on the streets of Tokyo. Many special effects, but engages the script nor interest in history. In addition, you know who gets the girl and who is humiliated in the final race.</body>
