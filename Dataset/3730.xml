	<body>The Ten is a modern revision of the ten commandments. Beautiful movie for ssutituir to the Charlon Heston afternoons of Easter (take note-producing television that the idea her cedo for free).Paul Rudd, the man who lives in nowhere with your tables presents ten stories to illustrate each commandment adventurous to star in one himself.The main problem of the tape is that all fragmented films. Equal to some stories are simply great others click and a little bored. Reminded me the excitement it caused in my New York stories (bridge the gap, a is a teacher and another a trivial entertainment) bright episodes of the boy that falls from the sky, or nudists but not so much for the sake of your neighbor, Christ or the doctor who quips. That Yes, the actors very correct, the creme de la creme: Paul Rudd, Jessica Alba, Winona Ryder, Adam Brody, Gretchen Mol, Famke Janssen, Rob Corddry, Liev Schreiber, Oliver Platt, Justin Theroux, Ken Marino. All of them jump of a story to another sharing small side with actors.A partial and moderate fun.</body>
