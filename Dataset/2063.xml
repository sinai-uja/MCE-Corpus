	<summary>Aims to play the trump card of the surprise ending, but it senses too soon what is going to happen.</summary>
	<body>The number 23 is the story of the obsession of a man by the number 23, believed that it pursues and it is everywhere. Becomes rather tiresome obsession, all added 23 and if not, we multiply and divide the times make lack until you exit 23?Jim Carrey is not bad, but it is a pity that it does not end succeed as a serious actor, because it has talent, as demonstrated in the Truman Show and forget about me, but with such films as the number 23 will never take you seriously.The secondary characters are empty and poorly built, some do not contribute anything to the story.The screenplay is terrible, full of gaps everywhere. There are really absurd situations and a dog that is intended to cause concern, but what causes is laughter. Aims to play the trump card of the surprise ending, but it senses too soon what is going to happen.</body>
