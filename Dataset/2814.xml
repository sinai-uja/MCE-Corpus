	<summary>Tom Shadyac is typical director of family comedies, and this is no exception, typical comedy that will like the kids of the House, and the elderly will have to bear a tape without being round makes water everywhere, and is that the script has been prepared or filming is clearly something that is worth remembering.</summary>
	<body>Say at this stage that I love Jim Carrey is extra, since all those who read me regularly know of my philias and phobias, as well, in this second installment in which Carrey said something as well as "upload here and you pedal (or give me more pasta") have to the recently booming Steve Carrell, lengthened the character who made the first delivery to the role, needless to say that Carrell fails even to touch the histrionics of Ontario (Canada) but in his role as Evan Baxter this nice, restrained at times and quite achieved elsewhere.Those who've followed even above the Filmography of Carrell, know he is a complete specialist in portraying normal men (both in "Virgin at 40" as always recommended in "Little miss Sunshine"), and although Evan Baxter is a Senator of the States, here, once again, is a normal name got into a mess of heavenly proportions.Tom Shadyac is typical director of family comedies, and this is not an exception, typical comedy that will like the kids of the House, and the elderly will have to bear a tape without being round makes water everywhere, which is that, or the script has been developed, or filming (one of the more expensive current film) is clearly something that is worth remembering.Too bad a film that promised everything and once again is nothing.</body>
