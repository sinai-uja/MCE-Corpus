	<summary>The area you think what to many current films, has an attractive initial approach, but that unfortunately it failed adequately develop.</summary>
	<body>Since the attacks of September 11, the contemporary society lives in greater or lesser extent, depending on the rulers of each country, immersed in a genuine culture of fear being security paranoia its maximum exponent. And when a society moves almost solely by fear, are exacerbated the injustices can be to commit acts of an unthinkable atrocity in a theoretically developed and advanced society.With the area, Mexican filmmaker Rodrigo Plá performs a metaphor on how the fear of the unknown, fear of insecurity, it can turn ordinary citizens into monsters. That was the intention of the film, but friend Oh, one thing they are intentions that can be extraordinary, and another very different thing is know to translate them properly. There are some approaches to the script from the first instant there is no who is those created, as well as a series of topics and situations very tired, which above not even given a good development. The characters are credible by the extraordinary work of the actors, among them a huge Daniel Giménez Cacho and a disturbing and frightening Carlos Bardem. It should also be noted that the area is well shot, sometimes enjoying great intensity, while in others lapses the pace considerably. The end looks coming from afar and not surprising at all.The area you think what to many current films, has an attractive initial approach, but that unfortunately it failed adequately develop. Most likely it's a too ambitious history for a new director.</body>
