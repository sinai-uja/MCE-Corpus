	<summary>Bob, Dante and Randal created the most endearing family from the Adams.</summary>
	<body>Try talking about Clerks, or the film Kevin Smith in general, without recourse to the word "freak" is quite difficult but necessary. The term itself, at least as I handling it, implies that the person in question need not be aware of their rarities. For example, Pilar LÃ³pez de Ayala in Alatriste is a freak because it acts as if it were a remote control by a UFO and I doubt very much that is aware of the strangeness of his behavior. Instead, that two people of 30 years decide to work in a fast food chain and spend the day discussing life (trilogy of Star Wars front trilogy of the Lord of the rings) not only it seems to me freak but is one of the more "healthy" decisions that can be taken.Ignoring the dialogues (which is not that they are good or bad: are real) and the Visual scketchs (the tribute of the silence of the Lambs is brutal) Kevin Smith film sticks out of the media because at no time arises that his characters are a few immature, a few outcasts, or some memos. We would appreciate that, for once, the characters do not realize the absurdity of their way of life and at the end of the film to achieve its long-awaited "maturity". In Clerks 2 opposite: they reaffirm their positions and Jay, Bob, Dante and Randal created the most endearing family from the Adams. That's called being honest with oneself and the truth makes you leave the film ready to vomit to any fan of the Lord of the rings. It is a choice: can be a whiner as Tim "oh, I'm weird, I suffer by this and all my characters suffer the same as I" Burton or, directly, you can assume what you are and live happily in your world. And if someone you scratch you don't have go to do a bit of karting. I wish I had more people like Kevin Smith in the world.</body>
