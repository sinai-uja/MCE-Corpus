	<summary>If he had not returned, nor nothing had happened. For fans of the most famous pugil of cinema, the rest, except what I have quoted, of the most forgettable.</summary>
	<body>Covered in a more than repetitive soundtrack, have this last episode (which reaches to remember the last few chapters of a television series) in the "Rocky" series starring Stallone, here more as an old decrepit and Dumpy, which by the shadow that was once one of the most famous actors of the action genre.A story that does not lead to nowhere, and is that me has interested or excited, nor I have imported as this minimum, forced return of Balboa to the big screen, where you have to wait more than 30 minutes. for something memorable happens and where the action is carried only the pugilísticas scenes.I have clear that Stallone is Eastwood, nor the 6th installment of Rocky is "Million Dollar Baby", but is that in this film even Sly becomes shadow of the later Hillary Swank; mention the film of boxing that I have in mind more fresh.On the other hand, should highlight the pugilísticas scenes, making one start to give punch to the armchair, as well as the presentation, under the patronage of the American channel HBO (namely the pasta that will have left by their presence on screen), in a film that never should have done.For fans of the most famous pugil of cinema, the rest, except what I have quoted, of the most forgettable.</body>
