	<body>I can only learn me already the name of Miyazaki, given that I've seen many of his films and I liked all. This type makes a film of which I alucinan, committed, perfect pictures and wonderful scripts. Not be that it happens to me lately, I think my Paraguayan media has changed me the deodorant or something, but I am a wobbly I cannot.The film is about Nicky, a small witch who, according to tradition, leaving her parents at age 13. Grab your cat Yiyi, the old broom from her mother, and part to another town to continue his studies of witchcraft. After a series of adventures, it ends in a large coastal city, which will cost you adapt a little.Nicky comes from an idyllic world, where all are respected and want to. His arrival in the big city is a critique of modern society, in which prevails the trampling on others. Not that it is a movie highly critical, but Miyazaki always leaves his strokes of moralizing, which never wrong. The script is quite childish, what does not mean that her they can see adults. The animations are still very good, and the curious characters. Yiyi cat, which is funny monda deserves special mention (my God, that expressions say, saquenme this 침o침ismo). The only that I put to the film is the end, is that suddenly the artists ran the pencil and the director said "already I don't buy more, until where we arrived". If not, I fail.In short, a delightful recording that satisfacir치 (encandilar치) to the adults stayed in Heidi. Adolescents will seem a FAG (with forgiveness) and the kids will love. You decide.kisses.</body>
