	<summary>One more among many romantic comedies that repeat over and over again sensibleros arguments.</summary>
	<body>I have never been excessively devoted to these American romantic comedies which are devoted to trying to reconcile the tear with laughter and sentiment, but since that begin all know that in the end, after a myriad of adventures, dimes and bickering, the protagonists end up together, with few exceptions.Although I must admit that I've always found curious the fact many of the great successes of the contemporary cinema from this genre extremely simple, repetitive and a little (or a lot) speech.Among women not you can frame is exactly in it, it is one of those movies where the story as a whole is of little importance and the weight of the script relies on the particularities and interactions between the various characters. Something similar to the style of Woody Allen, but bridging the gap between him and Jon Kasdan (writer and director), that even being a more than acceptable and contrasting author, does not reach the levels of brightness and dynamism in the dialogues that exhibits the New Yorker. The film narrates the adventures of a young man who aims to be a writer and who after a traumatic break-up with his girlfriend, moves to live in his grandmother's House, where the relationship with the neighbouring family soon cause a great impact on the life of the protagonist. The truth is that the film is not much, not noted anything, interpretations are rather ramplonas, and show a Meg Ryan surpassed by the role and Adam Brody too tear; disappointing by r√°cana and short, the appearance of Elena Anaya. The soundtrack, which saves many productions of this kind, nor gives the size. In general, except small flashes, mediocrity is the prevailing note.</body>
