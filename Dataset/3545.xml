	<body>This film doesn't fool anyone that from their debtors it tell you clearly, this is a frika performed in a couple of days with a script that was written in a night of drunkenness where the photography, music, address is conspicuous by its absence.I tell you from sharing because as soon as you see the name of the director you you remember other products his "DR ALIEN, the House in the middle of the road". Performers are those who point to all folly shaped film to win the chickpeas.GORDON Mitchell "Mission cobra, SHE" or RICHARD HARRISON "NINJA Holocaust" accompanied by actresses from very good to see that they live undress in stronger direct to DVD.If quality is expected with all the great professionals their story will see KUROSAWA that is not for your stomach. If by the upset they want to see sex, GORE, ass of infarction, operated breasts and some special effects that cause laughter sit to enjoy the art of exploitation without damage.Because that is another, the film happily copy everything which moves through Reanimator to fly with doses of Alien. Look where in the midst of madness filmmaker "is a saying" it is so hot dog pounding mercilessly the scene of HOLLYWOOD and the vanity of their stars, in a review I more would like her to productions of greater artistic value without the freshness of this series Z.Es fun if you see without complexes.</body>
