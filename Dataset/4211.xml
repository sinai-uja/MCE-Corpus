	<body>There are times that you see that the road you've gone was not correct, and the wisest way of doing things (and the hardest) is go back to the beginning and start again.Harry Dean Stanton plays perfectly to the defeated man, one who knows that happy days now will not return ever. If you see the movie its sad eyes will accompany you throughout life. Today looking for his filmography I noticed account that appeared in "For a fistful of dollars", "The conquest of the West", "The godfather" and even "the legend of el indomable", in which played banjo in ready "Midnight special" and "Cotton fields" in its original way before that Creedence Clearwater Revival made its great versions. In any case is a genius of the interpretation that I always went unnoticed.And the world discovered in "Paris, Texas" the magical beauty of Nastassja Kinski, a woman that I still do not know their origin. Is it American?. Russian?. Another world perhaps?. Too beautiful to be human.If we add to this that is headed by Wenders (quality assurance), that the picture is superb with flat barbarians of the Mojave Desert, Ry Cooder music put goose bumps and has a few scary dialogues (especially of the peep-show) is not to lionize the Olympus of modern cinema. It is difficult to make a better psychological portrait without bore. I even see like a prehistoric history of Forrest Gump.Me films that transmit a message of hope in its sediment, because once I've said it here. Somewhere has to see the light, and if not then is to make holes upwards for the next come back. Neither more nor less. This is the people I admire.
