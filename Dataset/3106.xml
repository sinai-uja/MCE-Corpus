	<body>Very hard drama that has as a starting point the history already seen in "Ecstasy", Mariano Barroso and Federico Luppi and Javier Bardem, although Zalla not done on purpose, surely even he has not seen the Spanish movie.In this new occasion, Zalla takes other paths much more dramatic to narrate a story of uprooting, search for the own identity, where the lies and misunderstandings are currency.Perhaps conventional film in the form of roll, but atypical by its harshness, harsh and detachment to the will of the Viewer, which sees astonished how destroy the lives of the aching characters, and without that can do anything help them.A few truthful interpretations, achieved climax of the streets of New York's disadvantaged neighborhoods (Brooklyn specifically), and nothing complacent argument, they make "Our father", a very worthy and honest film that already at the last Sundance international film festival won the Jurado.Explosivo Grand Prix Assembly and a frenetic pace for a sad and desolate history where the best and worst feelings of humankind are present in continuous conflict.It is not that he regarded as an excellent film, but has much strength and hypnotic results in some moments. Exquisite photography.</body>
