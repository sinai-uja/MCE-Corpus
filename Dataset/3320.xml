	<body>David Fincher is known for having directed two films which are already two modern classics: Seven and the Club of the fight, therefore everytime he directed a new film is expected much of him.Zodiac falls short of expectations, but I do not think that it will become a classic, but is a quality film, you can enjoy seeing it and when it just leaves the feeling of seeing good cinema, something that today is not abundant.Contrary to what is given to understand in the promotion of the film, the role does not focus on the character of Jake Gyllenhaal, but that is it split between three characters who evolve throughout the film.A police officer, a journalist and a cartoonist, have in common an obsession by the murderer of the Zodiac that causes a devastating effect on their lives. Initially continue the investigation of the police, but towards the middle of the film the two first characters "retire" to make way for the cartoonist, who takes the reins of the history, making a deep and thorough investigation into the murders of the Zodiac on the pretext of writing a book about it, then indeed if he came to write, and precisely this work is based on the film.Despite being a full of details research at any time we lose between tangled web of names that occur, unlike the film immerses us in research resulting in that the end is so frustrating for the Viewer as to the protagonists of the story.</body>
