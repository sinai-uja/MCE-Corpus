	<summary>A tape, which can perfectly cast as a Christmas episode of any television series, but which moves and entertains.</summary>
	<body>A film that premieres unprecedented in DVD, film and television at the same time, "Noel", directed by Chazz Palminteri (which reserves a cameo) and starring Alan Arkin, Robin Williams, Pen√©lope Cruz, Susan Sarandon and Paul Walker.Dividida in several stories (such as the winner "Crash") has a series of Christmas dramas, and, as in the majority of these films all degenerates into a "Happy End", most of the stories are "as real as life itself," from the Solitaire who thinks the hospital is the solution to their problems, the isolation between mother and daughter, loneliness and hope. Everything is reflected in this film.A tape, which can strain perfectly as a Christmas episode of any television series (these special in which it participates all living bug), but which excites and entertains.Happy 2007</body>
