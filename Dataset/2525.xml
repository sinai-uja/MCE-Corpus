	<body>Cu√≠n, I've seen you give The queen, ja, ja, if I don't do this baleful wit, bust and filled it all viscera and more guts. In a less humorous tone, these films of Kings and Queens I put bad milk. Think a so-and-so, unborn son of another guy who was the son of another guy to infinity and beyond, has more privileges than my son burned me the blood. It is said.The film is about a timely moment in the history of the United Kingdom, the entry into the Government of Tony Blair and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. Tells us how you lived these moments in Palace, reluctant to any public display of pain over the death of one, and lived it as the people, jaleado by its new ruler.Not be what well tell you. The film is not that it is well or badly, is rather documentary roll. The characters are quite well characterized physically, but not is if they are psychological as well. We assume that if. The atmosphere that recreates, seen mostly from the point of view of the Queen, is very aseptic, with a very cold Queen, advised by his centenarian mother. No, but as the Queen is so bad, what a gem they have. On the other hand, Tony is very close to the people, taking advantage of the refund to win over the people.In short, as film I finished like, since it is more a documentary with actors. It is interesting if you want to know a little about the Palace life of the residents of the island, but catches us as very distant in the skin of a bull. In addition, it is politically correct.It is going to take the time and little else.kisses.</body>
