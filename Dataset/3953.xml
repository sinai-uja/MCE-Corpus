	<body>"A morning appears dead on the beach a prestigious actress." The woman has been murdered with a man jacket belt.A young, from the top of the cliff he sees the body and descends to see how it is. Runs in search of the police and two women see you running away from the body. Calling southern while he explains everything to the police, they Lebanon you assassination, so dedice to flee to discover the true murderer. "Will help you, not without reluctance, the daughter of the Chief of police, which will be gradually falling for the young".Excellent film by Hitchcock, one of his last works in Britain, before embarking on the road to Hollywood. It is very good, cleverly mixing humor with the intrigue. The protagonist couple has great chemistry and both he and she are endearing and delicious.It has long and good humor, above all by the continuous dialogues between the two young men who are thrown puyitas full of irony and wit.For its part, intrigue, major asset in most of the tapes of the English magician, is well worn, with the last minutes in the pub where the murderer plays drums with the face painted black but its contiuos tics in his eyes, made by what can be recognized.Moments like the car being swallowed by the Earth in the old mine, the flight of the young of the police or the dinner of the girl with his younger brothers, are pure Hitchcock film. A superb movie with a title that could lead to deception.</body>
