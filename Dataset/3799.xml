	<body>After the unholy Kingdom of heaven, and the sentimental A good year, get American Gangster, which for many is last chance for a Ridley Scott who has been stumbling for many years. Between, a new edition of Blade Runner, which you clearly seems short, at least for a few years.It must be said of American Gangster the themes promise, despite sound to something already known by the Viewer. It is not the first time that police corruption in a large city like New York in the 1970s, or the rise of drugs, nor even less the rise and fall of a gangster is portrayed on the big screen. But despite this, Ridley Scott manages to weave a plot full of emotion that catches the viewer completely and intense. The film moves at a good pace, Scott is not recreated in the narrative, and the best proof of this is that it is not heavy or dull despite its long footage. British filmmaker offers not only the portrait of a gangster full of charisma (exceptional Denzel Washington) and the police that pursues him (a no less brilliant Russell Crowe), they sample at the same time the seizures that they beat a whole country: poverty, misery, corruption, war-Viet Nam, a deep emerged disenchantment among the population, all this sprinkled by the rise in the sale of drugs.And after all, American Gangster comes to be a mirror that reflects the vision cloudy and distorted the much vaunted American dream. And it is the land of opportunity is also full of misery, and nothing grows best between the misery as crime and corruption.</body>
