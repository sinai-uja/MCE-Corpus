	<summary>A film that becomes heavy and sings to shabby copy of those years of great film style. We need much more soak the film in the essence of the film.</summary>
	<body>Remakes, homages, copies, plagiarism? all these words enter the vocabulary of a cinema increasingly saturated with repeated ideas and recovery of styles and arguments. Steven Soderbergh, which seems that it do what they want, now sells us a presumable classic Court film simply because it uses the black and white and a music inspired by big scores of other movie times.The bizarre plot of this film painted with black and white and some actors trying to emulate the American cinema of the "Casablanca time" appear to be the only claim of a director used to do what he wants.Recover the curtains, rich orchestration music and a picture in white and black to disguise a history of conspiracies and secrets does not serve to make a moderately interesting film. In fact, all that style that aims to wrap the film as a "classic" collides head-on with many interpretative aspects and mise en scène.A film that becomes heavy and sings to shabby copy of those years of great film style. We need much more soak the film in the essence of the film.Notably, as always, the great work of Cate Blanchett and loabl attempt of Thomas Newman by blow a few notes in tune with the style that the director it has imposed.</body>
