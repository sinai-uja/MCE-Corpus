	<body>Let's see, when to kill Richard Nixon? It seems to me that this film begins lying to us. By the way, does in the poster Sean Penn seem one of those of the CIA responsible for disrupting the plans of murder of the presiendente? Flying there, with his image over the White House, as if the arcangel San Gabriel. As we cheat, really.The film is a man who is to see it. It has everything and does not lack detail. Begins the film just separated from his wife and this does not like to go to see her by surprise (basically because it is a bit slimy). On the other hand, it works seller in an Office furniture store, with a somewhat peculiar head. Finally, it has a black friend who leads a mechanical workshop with which you want to start a business. So with these letters that have given in life, a little paranoia and desire to change the world to the beast, gets 90 minutes Sean Penn. Exciting, huh?My mother than Ortuño truño. Damn, is that the entire film is infumable. Sure there are many people that are passionate about with this film based on a Mr wrong head and do pathetic things but not to. A server certainly not. In positive terms, the actors quite well, and impressive Sean Penn, being a tremendous performance recital. In the plain negative, everything else. The script lacks interest to film buffs mortals. History not hooked, and to even feel pity for the protagonist. In addition, you finish do not understand why is so bad head. Come on, that we did not like nothing at all.In short, for the viewer medium popcorn and flat encephalogram is worthless and can burn the film. For the brainy lovers, lovers of devious plots and characters of perverse depth, may them be interested. To the family of Sean Penn secure who love.</body>
