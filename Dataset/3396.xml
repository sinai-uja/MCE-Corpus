	<summary>Pleasant, charming and very funny. One of the best national films of the year, which is not something easy to achieve. Not too difficult either.</summary>
	<body>La Torre de Suso is the debut as director of Tom Fernandez, screenwriter tanning in television is launched in the film with this nice story.After ten years when outside returned to its homeland by the death of his best friend without no intention other than getting drunk with his old colleagues, pretend a little and get legs. But will not be as easy as I thought &hellip; reunion or friends of Peter are two referential theory films for the film by Fernández, but only in appearance because the director manages to move the history to its terrain and recreates, in part, his reality of the basin because let us not forget, La torre de Suso has a lot of autobiography. Javier camera is great (in all senses) and the rest of the cast manages a chemistry unusual for this type of our film making an emotional x-ray on family and friendship that avoids falling into the fussiness resulting surprisingly fun.Special mention for an immense Emilio Gutiérrez Caba as Tino, the father of Cundo and a cercanísima Malena Alterio who is responsible for the part, bridging the gap, wesandersoniana of history with the way its special relationship with Cundo.Una film that deserves all the luck in the world because it is well shot, has rhythm, much humor and know when give the key of emotions. A very pleasant surprise.</body>
