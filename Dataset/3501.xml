	<body>I saw this movie a few weeks ago and it caused me such mental straw that I have been unable to write about it until now.We are faced with a film whose political vision parallelizes with the vision of two students who decide to join ranks and the desperate attempt of a teacher to save the soul of which considers his best student. Such parallelism between these 3 stories whose background lies in the same theme, shows intimate way and with original narrative, as sometimes or rather always, Lions (plo√≠ticos, people influential.) use sheep (people excited, young, passionate, humble) to fulfil its objectives according to what they think right and proper and that power generates just one thing: desire for more power.Robert Redford is without doubt one of the best and most honorable actors of our age, fantastic actor, passionate director and producer implemented, shows which is perhaps her most committed film socially speaking. Lions for Lambs deserves a hole in our shelves of DVDs and is that as director, Redford serves a narrative so special as personal but absolutely recommended.If you have the overwhelming feeling of being overtaken by the political message of this film, it is that you has stalled, I like the films that invite reflection and against many opinions I have to say that this is a film that "invited" to think more does not "require" or "encourages" thinking about the political ideas of the director. It is a "this is what friends take out you their own comclusiones".</body>
