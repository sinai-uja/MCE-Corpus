	<summary>A valuable degree skilfully by the Francoist regime. A work important, challenging, funny and interesting, which we stole in an era bygone but always threatening.</summary>
	<body>"Will take place the elections for President of the United States." And therein he will appoint the candidate of one of the parties. The chosen is a honest and honest man who seems to be the most appropriate. "" However, an opponent of his party, you want to post, start a smear campaign based on slander and lies to put an end to his reputation".""It has all the character of a dog except loyalty."Very good film, which did not release in the Spanish commercial theaters since we talk about democracy, with capital letters, in a time where this political system was absent in the Spanish State. But leaving this aside, the film is very well told, with impressive performances, especially of Henry Fonda, Cliff Robertson and Lee Tracy.Es interesting, entertaining and, in addition, has enormous value to know the ins and outs of the elections in the USA Very good picture in white and black, great direction of Schaffner, remember director of great works that have fallen into the history of cinema, as for example "the planet of the apes", capable of achieving very worthy and distressing scenes with many figures and many extras (all rallies, for example).A work important, challenging, funny and interesting, which we stole in an era bygone but always threatening.</body>
