	<body>Since then the gathering I do not know if ten but yes five or six reasons to watch this movie. It is a delight unpretentious and with great sense of humor which in these times is appreciated. A film - which was intended initially to be downloaded by Internet in USA - Brad Silberling, accustomed to more generous productions - City of angels, A series of unfortunate events by Lemony Snicket-.morgan Freeman brings to life a celebrity low hours is forced to accept a role in a low budget film. To prepare your character becomes viewer of the daily activity of a supermarket on the outskirts of California. There, please contact with the only employee who speaks their language, a Paz Vega with very bad flea to the box?10 Items or less? -the much more successful original title of the film-.Does do forced relationship giving rise to dialogues and reflections of the most fun, in which each will learning from the other while they come from opposite worlds is established between them: the star who lives back to reality and the? mildolarista? that you want to prosper but lacks enthusiasm and confidence.The film does not have much more and not unleashes laughter but is a nice, entertaining film and seen with a smile. Highlights stars them Morgan Freeman making a commendable exercise in irony on his career and allowing jokes about productions as the collector of lovers. Paz Vega is adorable. Although in the Hispanic immigrant skin in Hollywood, she is charming and far exceeds its intervention in the forgettable Spanglish which marked his debut in American cinema.</body>
