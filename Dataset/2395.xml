	<summary>Good movie genre that takes on its own personality through the good making Fresnadillo.</summary>
	<body>Good continuation of "28 days later", which was directed by Danny Boyle and here co-produce the film, giving the labrum of targeting the Canarian director Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. The reason for this is that Danny Boyle liked much "intact", the first film of the Canary Islands. "28 weeks later" has much strength, with first fifteen minutes truly terrifying, daunting leaving without breath to the respectable.Once laid the seeds of terror, we are witnessing a good tack process of human feelings on family stability, threatened by the virus of fear on family guy. The latter is important for the future of the story, which continues with a seemingly unpleasant narration, given the many flat camera in hand, but give the wanted aspect of necessary confusion, fear, terror and panic. The camera stops when it should and Fresnadillo composes a poem of nightmare does not search public complacency, donating to each character that fate had reserved for him.Through an ochre photography, and a delusional and respond soundtrack us one and terrifies with such basics as the follow-up to down the stairs in the dark at the foot of two characters in the London underground or the real time gore and acojonante the meeting between spouses (pride in his short role as Catherine McCormack).Good film genre, which may have is slightly acutely Decompensated, with some slightly cheesy moment between the two brothers who both want, but containing excellent scenes, such as the helicopter "passing the scythe" in the field. Wonderful last level, which leaves no room for doubt.</body>
