	<body>One late after some excellent reviews in this website, but the happy memory of this languid Jarmush film makes one have wanted to write a few lines.Slow, slow, take your time to tell us without hurry, loving life and the woes of Don Johnston, a defeated man of the long list of interpreted defeated men to the measure by a great Bill Murray. Lonely and loser, is the classic protagonist of any work of Jarmush.Desfilan former girlfriends, with its limitations but that next to the Don, seem to live in a full roller coaster. The female cast is exquisite, all good. Jarmush knows well where is the story heading and leads with a beautiful music (the soundtrack is exquisite), towards the disenchantment of a father in search of your hypothetical child, in a cold way Yes, but with the timming of film independent in its maximum expression.Drama with touches of humor, its end is a delicacy that (with a cameo by one of the sons of Murray) which becomes the ideal as possible. Punto y aparte for Bill Murray. So we see repeat almost the same character, a being of parco, melancholic, as lost as charming, in a kind of Buster Keaton revived. With minimal gestures, cansino, building his walk among the autistic and unreal, already Sofia Coppola caught his psyche in Lost in Translation (2003). Wes Anderson made us wanting to as Steve Zissou in the Life Aquatic (2004) and in an almost cameo in Los Tenenbaums.De the hand of Jim Jarmush in Coffee and cigarettes (2003) first and in this Broken Flowers (2005), where again amazed with a kind of heavy, never as icy and gray Murray. We love each other in all those films.</body>
