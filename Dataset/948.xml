	<body>They tell us the history of the Italian family regarded as the most corrupt of the history, by betrayals, incest and murder quite rigorously.The movie is entertaining, although sometimes it is difficult to follow the thread of events, especially when the young Cesar Borgia launches the conquest of territories in Italy. Chronological rhythm is somewhat chaotic, arrives to lose the notion of the time that is happening.Reflected is that Lucrezia Borgia, seemed a santa, and isn't exactly as he remembered, as was an accomplice to the murders, betrayals and incest. Even she herself participated in some of these murders. Is true that among his contemporaries was remembered as an instrument of his father and brother for the purposes that were persecuted.Highlight especially the metamorphoses of the young actor Sergio Peris, although does not fit me too in the role of bad in this film. I guess his eyes maintains something of innocence and do not see making ruthless sadist.Finally I have to admit that I have not bored watching the movie, although it is not a film that has fascinated me, maybe it's the history I do not like too, and if I see something, I prefer epic stories. In addition, it shows the low-budget, I would have liked to see some of the struggles in battlefield, but guess become more that that had expensive enough tape.</body>
