	<summary>Comedy of flat encephalogram, lumpy humor and dubious taste.</summary>
	<body>Watching the trailer for the TV told me my intelligent part of the brain "this do not see her or in joke". But as in the end sends the irrational part of the same, because ale to see patochadas of a Lord of small size which makes your baby more ugly in the world.The film is a tiny thief of jewels out of prison after a long stay. Nothing more out, with his partner of normal size but small brain, steal a tremendous diamond. But something goes wrong and they have to hide the diamantón in the bag of a girl. Coincidentally, this girl has a boyfriend eager to be dad, so the two absurd minds cavil that the baby becomes a grotesque baby to recover the jewel. And it is already bundled.The creators of Scary Movie bring us this film of grotesque humour, in the style of the four previous, but much less funny. I have to admit that I laughed a lot, especially with the faces of the baby, but the thing is not for stalks are. The idea is very absurd and does not give a whole movie. But hey, if we invigorate the shock of seeing the small Lord (not be if it really is a dwarf or special effects) had a good time. To highlight the trajecitos that put, are to die for, and some scenes, especially those of sexual Court. The end was so they could have spared, that worthy even more the final product.In short, comedy flat encephalogram, lumpy humor and of dubious taste, what will not prevent us carcajeemos to taste. That if, leaving the brain at home and forgetting what is a coherent and interesting script. Rating: 2 out of 5 (and it is what God wants)</body>
