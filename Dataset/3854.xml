	<summary>Entertaining, well done, without excess of action... more than interesting.</summary>
	<body>I have not read the book, which as nearly any adaptation, desmerecerá it, but as a film it is a more than decent story, balanced, with the fair times between action and feelings of loneliness of a Will Smith great expressions, in addition to cuadrao.Who know New York, alucinará with scenes of ghost town.Made a more explicit narrative in lack what is wrong in the cure of cancer, and some deeper flashbacks. Also some consistency in the zombies who come to insinuate feelings (thought that the leader was going for his girl).A story that is not lost in action excessive with very good sequences as the dogs and that keeps you interested and entertaining from beginning to end. Worth the entry.</body>
