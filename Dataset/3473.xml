	<summary>Michael Clayton is a conventional thriller Yes, maintains interest and suspense, but of a gelidez such that fails get excited at any time.</summary>
	<body>In recent times have been sprouting like mushrooms with political dyes, some better, other worst thrillers, but this proliferation is in itself good news. And it is that of intrigue and suspense film has reached an impasse in the original ideas are conspicuous by their absence, and all films resemble others, or directly are crude copies.And unfortunately, despite the good appearance that conveys, Michael Clayton recalls in some respects to Erin Brokovich, by Steven Soderbergh, which is executive producer of the Tony Gilroy film. This and other handicaps, as the film begins practically with a flashbck, drag a story that on the other hand, neither manages to thrill altogether. It is a well constructed plot, although there are some details there is no who is created, which is well narrated despite some ups and downs in the pace, but completely sterile and unable to convey any emotion to the Viewer. If the film last man standing in is partly by simple curiosity of what will happen, and despite the initial flashback. It is true that the story gains in intensity in its final stretch, but what has kept it standing at this point is the work of the actors, among which stands out a brilliant George Clooney and a Tom Wilkinson.Michael Clayton incomensurable is a conventional thriller that keeps Yes, interest and suspense, but a gelidez that fails to excite in no time. Nor is it an original story precisely, but fulfills the role of divert and entertain the Viewer.</body>
