	<body>The head of this is a comedy by Lars Von Trier and, clear, that has its pros and cons, but the case is that it is a very fun movie where I am with two huge actors: Jens Albinus (seen in dance in the dark or the idiots) and Peter Gantzler (Italian for beginners) personally seems a tad excessive, because while it is true that you get to descojonar at times, the use of Automavisión leaves something to be desired, although in the case of the great Dane one is always ready for everything. The major drawback of this method is that the continuity of sound is not respected, and can cause dizziness in the Viewer.Finally, if you have left an hour and media can see that Lars also know to entertain themselves doing easy movies. In its own way.And get the girlfriend of Rob in high fidelity.</body>
