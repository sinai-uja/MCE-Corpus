	<summary>Audiovisual hybrid with Iran as the chosen scenario to recreate Afghanistan within a so atrocious as inescapable fable</summary>
	<body>Winterbottom returns to demonstrate his mastery of cinematic technique, something which has been evident in that his filmography has been catching packaging.Without a script written as such and with a few characters? true? they roam through a ficcionada reality, road to Guantanamo is of these films which stage a hard blow to the Viewer by its ideological and emotional burden. Film necessary, Yes, but also cinema dared not only by what it has, but by the way does it.The director of titles such as Wonderland, Welcome to Sarajevo and code 46 we have come precisely to that we get not used in their own way kind of filmmaking, disparate projects and others, but with the same rigour as its aesthetic and formal precision. Its last release again an audiovisual hybrid with Iran as the chosen scenario to recreate Afghanistan in a fable as atrocious as inescapable.Strongly resembles this variant of the way the hell in this world (In this World), the film in which the British filmmaker was the adventures of two young Afghans from Pakistan, starting a journey of no return by the silk route to London which holds a promised Eden on a future better. Path? approaching to the documentary genre, but it is not like other more journalistic products that it is intended to highlight the component of entertainment that has all fiction. Do do the drama of? the Tipton three?, three British Muslims confused with terrorists and shipped in the worst trip of their lives, stars this essential story to position ourselves, with solid arguments, terror policy imposed by Governments before the imperialist desire, camouflaged as a survival instinct before the American colossus, from countries such as Iran and United States.</body>
