	<summary>When Kurosawa left the Sake and switched to the Bourbon.</summary>
	<body>The simple moral dilemmas and the most possible masticaditos, have always plagued the Hollywood Thriller, to try to give depth in the background, mere stories of cops and thieves. Remember the very famous end of Seven: do kill the murderer of your wife if you had a gun in his hand? "Or Dirty Harry" to stop a serial killer is necessary always adhere to laws garantistas? "The hell of the hatred" (1961 Kurosawa) is no exception to the rule: "Do Salvar√≠as life to a child, at the expense of your money?"? And Kurosawa, in one of his less lyrical productions and personal, presents us with a film calcada to the American canon. Since the Westernization of the characters (even children play dresses of the Wild West) up to the pace of the American suspense and its numerous plot twists. Handles with ease the elements of intrigue and wheel a brutal film: but without grace, as if trying to imitate to Fritz Lang or other masters of the classic crime film.There is a hero that his friends leave only, efficient police disturbed by the intelligence of the antagonist, a fourth power willing to collaborate with the order to capture the malefactor, a stroll by the lower depths of the city and a redemption of the villain of the piece at the end of the footage. Or a novelty, or a single element or anything. Perhaps only the sequence of the discotheque, which in 7 minutes is more "Nouvelle Vague" many movies of an hour and a half of Godard.Y is a pity, as we have said, because it is a brilliant story told with mastery and a narrative pulse who never trembles, but with very little originality and exotic charm. 8 But with a tantrum for not putting a 9.</body>
