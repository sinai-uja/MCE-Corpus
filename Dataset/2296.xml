	<summary>A worthy finale to a trilogy that shows clear signs of exhaustion in their plots and dialogue. Soderberg, c´est fini</summary>
	<body>After the third part of Pirates of the Caribbean, it is the turn to the most famous band of robbers in recent years: that of Ocean. If the first delivery were the Ocean 11 (eleven Ocean´s), the second added one more to his band (Ocean´s twelve) and in the third and it seems that ultimately add to the tenth third (Ocean´s thirteen). Following the line of the previous two, above all from the first, this time the target returns to be a casino, directed by a ruthless director who embodies the always brilliant Al Pacino; as remarkable novelty, the addition of Andy Garcia as member number 13 of the friendly group. While still being entertaining, the truth is that clear signs of exhaustion of ideas, still significantly lower than its predecessors in wit, sarcasm and originality can be seen in this film. Similarly, the removal of the female component which in previous deliveries embodied Julia Roberts and Catherine Zeta Jones, also means a significant decline of the ramifications of the main plot, that the appearance of Ellen Barkin is far from achieving the transcendence of the two divas. With the lack of dynamism, the excessive length can be a drawback for a film which ultimately is aimed to an eminently juvenile public, or at least, carefree. The reality is that everything has an expiration date, and of these thieves has already come (perhaps did so with 12 Ocean´s), but the truth is that its own creator and director of three deliveries, has decided to put the point and end of rightly, I believe, to the vicissitudes of the most stylish robbers of the big screen. Acceptable, and point.</body>
