	<body>Mediocre, although more or less entertaining film of Michael Raddord which, undoubtedly, has known better times. Here is limited to narrate a story of "great robberies", with little imagination, though aided by good make that interpretive monster that is Sir Michal Caine. When he leaves, the film is frankly, being a real pleasure to hear him in original version.In his scenes, especially the time in which attempts to enter the vault where the diamonds, while the guard is eating something rather than looking at the screens that has front, the excitement and intrigue lurks with force. This I said is a totally incredible moment, but that is the film. However, the rest of the narrative is more conventional you can see, having in addition a great handicap: it takes enough to enter in the field, perhaps because it is necessary to know the various characters, but in my opinion it would have been better to start with a prologue with force to engage the Viewer.This is not true and so the Ribbon is more cold, seeing as who hears rain: without any passion. You spend the time and not bored, certainly, but knows little and forget the five minutes.</body>
