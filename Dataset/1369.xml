	<summary>A very decent see show but to followers of Scott may be a disappointment, as it is my case.</summary>
	<body>Ridley Scott (sold in insulting manner as "The director of Gladiator" as if the general public knew not the director of Blade Runner or Alien) has chosen an interesting story with an anachronistically modern treatment and a completely repellent character at the hands of Orlando Bloom. With the excuse that the original installation was 3 hours and 40 minutes and that will come out on dvd next year, Scott has released the version in theaters and feels precisely that there are problems of mounting: too many things in a short time. And worst of all, many nuances of characters that enrich the story for sure that they are in the hour and a half we'll see next year.Except Bloom (its presence gives well on screen and the character, but not his acting ability), the rest of the players are fine. Special mention to Eva Green (have to lavish more on the screens!)Although Scott has the healthy habit of recreating a realistic giant scenarios, some digital maps sing. The music, another element that I expected something outstanding, stays in an anecdote, that the main theme of Gregson Williams "adorns" several sequences, leaving the rest of the movie on incidental issues, some issue with vocals (very good), and the "incomprehensible" inclusion of a theme from the soundtrack of "Hannibal" and another of "the Warrior No. 13 &#8243; of Jerry Goldsmith." Gives the impression that Scott was not too satisfied with the work of Harry Gregson Williams.En short, a very decent show to see but that for fans of Scott may be a disappointment, as it is my case. It is a film of epic adventures without "chicha or another".</body>
