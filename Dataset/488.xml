	<body>With a budget of something less than 20 million euros, and a young team of production, Josh Harnett including recounts through uncasting in State of grace (in particular a huge Ben Kingsley, his best performance in years, forget about the overrated "Sexy beast"), the adventure of Slevin, a kid found in wrong time and place?After a trailer in which it appeared that Guy Ritchie could start to sue everyone, the movie is with great ease and saves the visual impasse without remembering just in English, very nearly, achieving a unique style, although the genus ande sobrado "aesthetes". History, bizarre where they exist, achieved tying up without too many traps (although any, hail) and liked in its passage by Sundance, where a remarkable future you have ventured to its director. The screenplay by Jason Smilovic persuaded actors, as Willis, he confessed in his umpteenth role of murderer.In the USA has raised almost its budget (which isn't anything wrong taking into account that it was released almost at the same time here, the last nine day), and Spain takes nearly two million since its premiere day seven, so no one will regret to make accounts.The note is affected by a couple of under, but the movie has a frenetic pace (the initial flashback is spectacular) and "walls swamped most beautiful recent cinema", A phrase: "Charles Chaplin participated in a tournament of imitators of Charlie and came third." This is an anecdote. A 6´5.</body>
