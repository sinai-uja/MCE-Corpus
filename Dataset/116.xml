	<summary>A delight of film for children</summary>
	<body>ZATHURA, against much criticism pseudo-intelectualoide arrogant circulating out there, found me a wonderful film logradísima, both for children and for adults who are still able to enjoy an adventure full of imagination, well told, with a great deal of good special effects, humor, surprises and tenderness and, above all, enjoyablewithout decay at any time. Some lovers of art and essay or animation manga for kids tildarán of corny the message of Fund on good relations between brothers (or any of our peers), but my find me added value in the midst of so much gratuitous violence that surrounds the smaller lately and that brings them so little.Fantastic and charming design of the gameboard. Flying the House reminds me of the nostalgic film "The wizard of Oz" that was once an ode to imagination and dreams. It highlights the good performance of the kids, and I dare to assure that many kids will be identified with a multitude of scenes! There is a fun balance between laughter and scares.In short, genuine critics here are children, and just need to listen to their enthusiastic comments when it ends the film. Don't miss out of the cinema the faces and words of the kids who have close. Surely they will be surprised.</body>
