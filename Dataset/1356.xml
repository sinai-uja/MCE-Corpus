	<body>I have seen the vaunted "masterpiece" and a promising Isabel Coixet film. I went with eager to see it because it is one of the promises of the film Spanish for this year, even if it is shot in English and with an international cast which is only Javier camera by Spanish side. Produce the Almodóvar and MediaPro.Como do not want to give too much advertising, I will only say that it complies with the typical topics of work that wants to be deep and dense. Repeated constants: characters with a terrible secret drama in his past (in this case add a protagonist completely anticipada and bitter), and everything serves to a supposed explosion of contained emotions that serves as a nexus of Union between two people alone and injured reluctantly. To that sounds like the typical ponderous explanation of "indie"?Therefore this is. This film reflects how to make a perfect artificial drama, how to try to get tears and emotions of the most childish way (although the Robbins-Polley relationship are the best moments) and switch the attention of naïve form of a personal drama to a collective tragedy. One of the most attractive things in the scripts is that have the characters without express it verbally or at least not openly or directly.But this movie will be named as work teacher, pure cinema and whatever they want because it is "jar" and "herposa" and perfectly meets all the canons of "indie" film as compliant with the clichés of action cinema one of Van-Damme, but is artificial pure cinema. And like everything else, it will have its viewers, faithful, followers and admirers? and detractors.</body>
