	<body>How continue to give opportunities to the film Spanish after watching movies as "Ca처tica Ana"!The film gives false hopes that we will see something good, perhaps not so much as "Lovers of the Arctic Circle," unforgivable early but something remarkable. Nothing could be further from the truth. There comes a time that Medem is going completely the gripper and literally puts it at Ana on a boat heading to the most absolute film chaos. The film from then on seems a wealth of disjointed ideas recorded at random in a roll of film. Within these ideas we must highlight (negatively) which allude to American policy. "I think that I, like most assiduous viewers, are tired of seeing how the Spanish film is limited to criticize, or rather, to criticize evil.""Chaotic Ana" WINS to pulse adjectives such as bland, pretentious and, above all, ridiculous. The plot is a simpleton aberrant, producing a sense of surprise and such a disbelief before what you see there are even wanting to laugh at pure skepticism. Honestly, I don't think that nobody in their right mind will be able to get into a film which focuses on the theme of reincarnation so absurdly.In short, go see "Ca처tica Ana" is simply a waste of time and money.</body>
