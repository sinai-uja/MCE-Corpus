Suddenly almost consecutively chains two comedietas far below his talent in question of balls and the current school of pringá you where accompanies JHON HEADER an actor aiming NAPOLEON DINAMITE ways although I think to stay pigeonholed in comedies of little nature.Specialist TOD PHILLIPS already carried out STARSKI and HUTH, bartkowiak trip between any other returns to serve a mediocrity of any grace where development is terribly boring with moments that border the vulgarity with zero narrative agility.Some really unfortunate interpreters attached to a terrible script leave this film at the height of the worst of the year.</body>
