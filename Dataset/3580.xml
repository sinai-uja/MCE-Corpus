	<summary>Fatal weapon should be the typical film should prescribe psychologists for patients suffering from depression, because after two hours of laughter, who is not you happy mood and spirit?</summary>
	<body>It is curious the case of Zombies Party, a film when it premiered in theatres passed without penalty or glory, but that when it came out on DVD it became something more than a transient phenomenon and became throughout a cult film praised by critics and public. The combination of fine English humor with the purest parody was an explosive mixture.Now comes a Fatal weapon (again the translation of titles has crime), the new film of Zombies Party responsible for. On this occasion, they launch their darts full of irony and sarcasm against the police film and serial killers. In a year in which fun and intelligent comedies are more rare than the Iberian lynx, weapon Fatal landing is a great joy for the spectators suffered, tired of the jokes for mindless proposed by Hollywood. And is that Edgar Wright with his scathing and ironic vision of things laughs at everything and everyone with a corrosive sense of humour which does not leave puppet head (sometimes literally, and if not they should ask to Tim Messenger). Fatal weapon has a rhythm so increadibly fast that sometimes you lose a joke by laughing be at even the previous. For nearly two hours, the film does not offer even a second of respite between so much laughter, at last twenty minutes absolutely hilarious and surreal.Fatal weapon should be the typical film should prescribe psychologists for patients suffering from depression, because after two hours of laughter, who is not you happy mood and spirit? Certainly one of the comedies of the year, not only for their own quality, but by the lack of the same in almost all others.</body>
