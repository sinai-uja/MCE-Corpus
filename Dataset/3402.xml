	<summary>In this case, was never more true that expression of "I liked more the book..."</summary>
	<body>I admit, without embarrassment that I love all the books by Michael Crichton, (well, less "Congo" that seems unbearable.), but I do not understand the reason for Crichton, seeing as always, or almost always (there this except for "Jurassic Park" and "Harassment") the rest of films River completely narrative resources of his works, and, as in the vast majority of cases, pass them through the film sieve are bland, poorly made and even worse addressed.In this case, "Rising sun" is not an exception, a tape that, read on paper is attractive, fun, fresh and well developed, and that its passage on screen, only fit to highlight the interpretations of Sean Connery, the frugal appearance of Tia Carrere as woman vase of the same, and Wesley Snipes, bland and linear to the more not being able, light years from the "animal of action" which was much later.The script, in which Crichton has enough "to say" stays in water of Borage and is so predictable and so poorly led since the first min. and despite having some spin script (which also has the novel), just disappointing the most painted, especially if you you read the work in which it is based.In this case, was never more true that expression of "I liked more the book."</body>
