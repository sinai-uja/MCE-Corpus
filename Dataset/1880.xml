	<body>They have managed, I can only say that, what they have achieved. See that people say you've seen documentaries of the Serengeti where the lion sestea low in baobad and the Leone goes hunting, so returning to the home which sesteaba it take a cap of 10 seconds before returning to the siesta. And we all know that it is a lie, that loves to run the the Serengeti Lion run to do like him (without the polvete) and bleed the sofa. Because they have succeeded. They have managed to combine the culture of seeing a documentary, with cultural see a porn movie. The bad thing not worth to take the siesta, but if to help raise the middle of patria machidad, who walks on the floor.The film, forgiveness, the documentary on which say the most profitable film of all time, Deep Throat. With a budget of 25 000 dollars it is believed that he has raised a whopping 600 million of dollars. How he did that? This is what tells the documentary. But not only that, if not the revolution in the country of the opportunity and alleged freedoms. Where, under skin of lamb, hide wolves eager to nail their jaws in everything that smacks of liberation. Anodadado I am still, and not only because of the skill in the art felatorio of the girl.Well, I must say that the critical documentary genre coming from the other side of the pond tend me to like much. In this case, it is true that we can not believe what we see. As I have said before, if this happens in the Spain of the Caudillo, since it would have its logic, but in the country of opportunities it seems unreal. Which could assemble for this film totally exceeds the limits of the human imagination, leaving open to ridicule his famous Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisition. The documentary is divided into parts, the filming of the movie, its dissemination, the uproar, the trial (I swear there was opinion, by the way, get Jack Nicholson as a young man) and the resolution of the story. Totally impressive and indispensable, although leaving something strong and hilarious scenes.In short, shocking documentary about the most profitable film of all time. It is a reflection of a society that is very advanced and is motivated by religious fanaticism, the shadow and absolute law enforcement powers. Very necessary.Tremendous documental√≥n.kisses.</body>
