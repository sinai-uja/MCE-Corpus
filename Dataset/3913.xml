	<summary>In short a typical film of action and horror that is at least bearable by their superb technical effects, even if you have to load with a few expressionless protagonists.</summary>
	<body>The great graphic novel written by STEVE NILES and illustrated by BEN TEMPLESMITH. In those moments where that kind of illustrations at the maximum peak of popularity her only film premiere could be a matter of time.DAVID SLADE that comes from success with his opera prima HARD CANDY, the macabre game where the hood ate the Wolf is responsible for carrying out a less risky production to be given a succulent box office.The cast already leaves me cold with the bland JOSH HARTNETT "SIN CITY, THE FACULTY" and the no less mediocre MELISSA GEORGE seen recently in tourists.Two pretty faces that certainly do not represent nowhere near some action heroes faced a horde of blood thirsty monsters.Unless the director has talent to wrap the environment on an unhealthy picture accompanied by good makeup effects and special that puts you in an entertaining plot.Is to thank the nothing concealed brutality of vampires, better forget about the referent romantic of these creatures because these only have desire to kill.Anyway the final part is fully topical with an ending modelled to the bucket 2 that the Lord of the bull you should not minimum grace.In short a typical film of action and horror that is at least bearable by their superb technical effects even if you have to load with a few expressionless protagonists.Highlight that he is responsible for the production the popular author of infernal possession or Spider-man SAM RAIMI.</body>
