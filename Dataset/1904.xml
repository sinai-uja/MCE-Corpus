	<summary>The dialogues, as literary desparpajo, produces the sensation of watching some wonderful play...</summary>
	<body>Her ferrea censorship of the dictatorship of Franco, newly erected as helm of patria morality, saw the immense damage that this film could make: seeped his blasphemous and proposed liberal. That of which a citizen, one very precariously supplied hopes in the world of work and defenestraded by a firmly convinced of the mediocrity of the future bride, decides to commit suicide and proclaim his farewell to this world, not married the Christian idea of endure the hardships of this world waiting to embrace the virtues of the other, i.e., the cósmico-redentora theory of the Catholic Church. And even less than the suicide, in full possession of his mental faculties, be devoted during the entretenidísima time and very little footage to pontificate the happiness of his State of mind and ignored the boring, bland and decadent life of who drowned by misery, tied to an unhappy marriage or enslaved by work that nothing gives them and low-paidthey persist without another benefit that let live melancholic and perhaps gradually.Wenceslao Fernández Flórez, the great Galician writer, recreates the archetype of the rogue of our golden age, in love with his manga tahúr, but reinvents it and transforms into a pícaro-filósofo, foul-mouthed and viperino, judgemental and sane until the Bachelor's degree that demonstrates the enormous sadness of the world in which he has had to commit suicide, one as wealthy enough, discursively speaking, as the weight of the argument it apparent to withstand without fracture: there is no scene that doesn't come out, there is no twist of the plot is not well underpinned in the light of psychological evolution of the character.Anthology, the scene in which Federico Solá decides to make public his drastic decision and instead of talking about armed cement, his professional specialty, uses the rostrum from which has been called to lecture to bother amazed membership with a catechism of truths as fists until that, in the end, pompous, advertise the audacity of your company.Dizzying in their dialogues, the man who wanted to kill is adult film over a film production planted in the rigors of a necessarily poor postwar and where the regime had conceived the strategy to entertain the people with the folk lightness of the sketches, almibarado portrait of the virtues of simplicity and, above all, the scarce artistic demand upon a (the film industry) used to entertain winners and losers, and join them, albeit in the sweet darkness of cinema.(At times, believe one be attending a comedy of the Marx Brothers: sparkling dialogues, delusional surrealism..)</body>
