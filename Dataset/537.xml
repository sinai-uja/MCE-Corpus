	<summary>Loose Spanish comedy film. Santiago Segura and Jose Corbacho not guaranteed laughs, must work more situations. Or is it that you didn't for more history?</summary>
	<body>Homeland film is a curious way define a type of humor that just like in Spain. That kind of make jokes that no one else would understand, if not us. These are the films of Pajares and Esteso, Segura, Chiquito, etc. They are jokes of latter, Marianico short, Arévalo, etc. Lumpy humor that is known. And usually I love Yes.The film is a group of kids that come together to participate in the national competition of the machine dancing, an arcade machine in which dance steps occur. The reasons are disparate and commanded by should a paralytic "head" recreational which in its time was a great dancer (as well as other things). Also appear there by the owner of the recreational, a few Legionnaires and a few Buddhist Middle East. And little else.The patriotic cinema, a world to know. Look at that I her I wanted to see with good eyes, trying to laugh, but not. The beginning is very well, with a couple of very good jokes that caused me laughter. But as the script is going to stabilize, the jokes lose interest and you do not know very well if you face a parody of American films of improvement in team or it is simply a bad film of this type. Regardless of this, the film has very little. Corbacho make something of grace, especially with your burner, Segura makes very little, and the rest of the cast does not average (the legionaries if). And as there is no nudity, well, nothing.In short, loose Spanish comedy film. Santiago Segura and Jose Corbacho not guaranteed laughs, must work more situations. Or is it that you didn't for more history?</body>
