	<body>I don't like leaving the film thinking that I lost the time. Why I try to fix me at least one good thing of each film to justify viewing but it will cost me with this. The penalty is that with Mr Brooks does not give you a remote control in order to pass fast camera that you're not interested at all. And it is that this film is very slow, so much that it seems that Kevin Costner and Demi Moore have been infected and their acts and actions are slow.Mr Brooks is a brilliant business man with a family that seems perfect. But in his spare time he has a peculiar hobby, is addicted to assassinate couples. Although there was a time in which made it very often seems now ready to quit but events will force to kill at least twice more against their will.There are two things that do not convince me. The first is the director bored with classic and levels unnecessary to making the boring history and decides to go crazy in the final gunfight breaking the aesthetic black and sober himself had been raised to create, the other is Marshall, his own Jiminy cricket as quite unoriginal schizophrenic resource Marshall is much more fun and charismatic than Brooks and in fact much more readyPerhaps they should have opted to change the real character and the fictional and the experiment would be the sea of interesting.</body>
