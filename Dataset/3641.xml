	<summary>Entertaining movie, which will not go down the history of animation, but that will make you smile to taste without stridency.</summary>
	<body>To the rhythm of productions of today, animated films and taking into account that every time it is more difficult to surprise, Bee Movie entertains and makes you have a good time, that Yes, without being nothing out of this world.The worst is the story itself, flojita and based on facts that collide a little, as almost always intended to save communication between bugs (either bees or mice) and human.The part of jokes concerning the world of bees, work fairly well, the clever word games and quite funny phrases, joined by some cameos, like Ray Liotta or Sting, who have his grace.Visually, spectacular, although technically, it is assumed that always go to more, the action sequences are well shot, with magnificent landscapes of Central Park flights, as well as the activity within the hive.As for characters, a little poor, but enough to sustain itself.Squeaking me, (as it is the case in many American films) that ego centrism that are erected spokespersons and protagonists, until for blooming flowers from around the world and repopulating Central Park, they save the planet.In the final analysis. Witty at times, smile with more than one laugh, for children and adults, but not only for some or for others, what makes staying a bit in no man's land.</body>
