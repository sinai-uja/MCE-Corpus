	<summary>Unbearable hodgepodge of the comic pair less evenly and less comic on the national scene. Cannot be a film with Arévalo in the 21st century.</summary>
	<body>I swallow the unbearable hodgepodge of the comic pair less couple and fewer comic on the national scene.Often cluster of nonsense this sequel without imagination, without a script. and without locations (!), approximately 90% of the footage is indoors.Directs this time Miguel Angel Lamata, who had debuted with the most entertaining (though equally bad) one of zombies.In the end, the director and his team have seen Zoolander and the two movies of Wayne´s world and a bit of comedy USA type Dodgeball to shoot an infumable film that lasts 85 minutes (thank God) and has no any kind of estructura.¿Montaje? Removed, removed.Cannot be a film with Arévalo in the 21st century.</body>
