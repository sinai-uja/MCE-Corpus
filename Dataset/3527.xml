	<summary>One of the best works of master Elia Kazan.</summary>
	<body>"Blache arrives in New York to visit his sister." There met Stanley, husband of his sister, a tough and virile man. "Man shall have no consideration for his sister-in-law".Excellent film master Elia Kazan. Certainly one of his best works and which you gave the world fame to its male protagonist, Marlon Brando. This already played the role of the rough Kowalsky on stage with Kim Hunter. Same as the great Karl Malden. Therefore the three are as well, because they knew imply their roles. However Kazan wished that the film star was not Hunter but Vivien Leigh. I am not going to say if it was better or worse because you never know, but the work of Leigh there is for posterity.A work dense, harsh, unforgiving, with magnificent dialogues, wonderful sunset scene and wise leadership.A real lesson of the film that is never forgotten, above all its striking final.Excellent music of the great Alex North, who introduced for the first time in film as a film, the jazz soundtrack. I did in this film, which was a world event which, however, was not recognized in the most important awards given to the film. Another stain on the curriculum of North, who was nominated for the Oscars nothing less than fifteen times, and did not win more than the honorific gave fellow that did know of the mass the average good.</body>
