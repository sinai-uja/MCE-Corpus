	<body>Daniel Myrick co-directed the project of the Blair Witch, an icon, a classic and a true horror movie. This does not mean that the kid has talent, because seen his new telefilm perhaps the criterion put him teammate Eduardo Sánchez (I very much doubt, that was a flute that rang once and will not sound). But removed them the bailao).Believers, a "direct to dvd" is a failed attempt to create a realistic terror tells the abduction of two doctors by members of a sect. They are ninety minutes of garbage yet I fail to understand as I held my. But if the movie are passed in a single toilet!!!The touches of fantasy, it seems there are, are so casposos, uncouth, boring and crappy that they go unnoticed, although the end is for despollarte of laughter. A cluster of absurdities script without any interpretation. It is what is said, fucking shit.</body>
