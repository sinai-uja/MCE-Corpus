	<summary>The episode portrayed by Tobey Mcguire, with death knocking on their door, in a scene typically alleniana is quite fun.</summary>
	<body>Harry Block is a writer who uses their sentimental and family experiences to write his works. As a result, their families and their ex-mujeres hate you. Its ancient University will honor and he is not with whom go, so he kidnaps her son and hires a prostitute to go with them.Woody Allen plays her character, a neurotic depressive and hipocondr√≠aco and it makes us laugh, as always, but fails to be as good as might have been that the film has quite a few ups and downs, there are very good moments and other extremely boring.The reality is mixed with the fictional stories of the novels of the protagonist, and these stories are the best of the film.Deconstructing Harry has some small actors in Hollywood, such as Demi Moore, Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Tobey Mcguire, all of them make small roles in small episodes of the novels of the protagonist.The episode portrayed by Tobey Mcguire, with death knocking on their door, in a scene typically alleniana is quite fun and is also of Robin Williams, an actor who is out of focus, reflecting the State of mind of the writer.Another great moment: the descent into hell of Woody Allen, that lift and the conversation with the devil, Billy Crystal.Cuando the film returns to reality, the history lapses slightly, partly because it is not easy to imagine Woody Allen as a conqueror.</body>
