	<body>Indeed, the assessment of Oldboy would be from very good to excellent, something as 9 points. Perhaps its final part is more melodramatic of the aconsejabale - to be perfect - but we will not be so stringent. Oldboy is another example that when Asians want to, make another film has no raison d ' être. The script is impeccable at the beginning, with the capture of a man imprisoned for 15 years and without any kind of explanation, and then his release, nor any uninformed. The Assembly, the ellipsis, everything of a taste for economic of forms, without forgetting the beauty of the images. Oldboy (2003) awarded in Cannes, is the jamóm of a trilogy begun earlier by Sympathy For Mr. Vengeance (2002) and ending in Sympathy for Lady Vengueance (2005), all watered the same aesthetic violence, pain of loss, in a rare mood - dropper- and as their titles indicate, full and trouts revenge stories. Adaptation of a manga of cult (Yes!, another comics movie!), the Korean director Park Chan-wook florea own making style, both by theme. Scares their excessive fame of violence is not such, but Aa all lights Oldboy is unmissable.</body>
