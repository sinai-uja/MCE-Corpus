	<summary>Long life to Dante and Randall though I very much fear that we will not come back to see more.Congratulations to Kevin Smith, often crack!</summary>
	<body>The big question was, does exceed the first after so long and is considered a cult movie? I imagine that many purists will say that no such and that which, but the truth is for me Yes. In all in the address quality, dialogues and characters (the brides of Randall, especially Rosario Dawson is tremendous (fits perfectly in the role despite being a star) and the Geek of the Burger). It may was that the intervention of Bob me waiting best, but well, he forgives her.Most notable is the same (and that is good) from the first, the conversations between the characters (mostly nonsensical or important, such as pregnancy or the war between the Lord of the rings and star wars). One of the best points of the movie is the explanation of Randall on the three movies of Peter Jackson, not to mention the farewell Dante.Jay and Bob as always, theirs, are followed exactly equal. Ben Affleck also appears in the form of cameo (hopeless era).Best in direction is top in black and white, as with the first movie at a time and with quality, and the end, I not betraying but yes advance is fucking great!Long life to Dante and Randall though I very much fear that we will not come back to see more.Congratulations to Kevin Smith, often crack!</body>
