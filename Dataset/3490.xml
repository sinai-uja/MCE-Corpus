	<body>There is not much difference between Shrek and Beowulf if you see the two in a conventional movie theater. If instead you enter to see the last movie (!) by Robert Zemeckis to a room that has projection in three dimensions also unbearable brain pangs guaranteed you during the first five minutes, until that man gets used and focusing with both eyes. Then you have some little beater something, but do not think you that you will see how a sword you approaching the fronted and such, that is in the amusement parks. Beowulf is the cinema of the future. and that'm me afraid.The story we already know all and know very well that is quite heavy, so suspicions are confirmed quickly.The movie is a bit boring and extremely long (two horazas) and I suppose that it will be technically brilliant, but my grieved me for the mogollon eyes. The characters are the image of its actual performers except the prota, is a fat Lord and that it not end catch.The big question is. what not lasts eighty minutes pelaos, Robert?</body>
