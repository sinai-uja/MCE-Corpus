	<body>Ovation (more than one) in the room for the new point of French that will save the genre. With "High voltage" single was warm, who was going to say, right? AJA has won in narrative, getting an hour of footage in which load tension with an inhuman atmosphere making putting full Viewer in the plot for a second part b-r-u-t-a-l which, literally, there is no puppet head.A (wonderful) thing is happening in the genus, especially with the remakes. In recent years we have seen a facelift face rather than correct abodes of fear, notable Texan and outstanding resurrections of dead killings. The hills have eyes 2006 enters into the latter category. An overwhelming prologue which seems to take place on a reddish planet and appropriations that scary give the kick-off of a movie that can be enjoyed in crescendo and in which Mr. Nicotero leaves his signature every five minutes.Thrills, surprises, (much) gore (but much much) and, especially in the final stretch, cutting that will always more and leadership that lapses not a single second. Mention apart for the prodigious Tomandandy soundtrack and the arid photography Maxime Alexandre. Curious name, serves to define the film, "Maximum Alexandre". 9.</body>
