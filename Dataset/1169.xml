	<summary>In this type of movie one cannot ask more than what appears on screen, entertainment, a script where things happen because yea, and the feeling that one had one evening, in his childhood where he played with similarly with Indians, Romans, tanks and dinosaurs.</summary>
	<body>Shawn Levy, director, namely "The Pink Panther", "Twelve at home" (and its subsequent sequel), or the curious "Honeymooners", directs Ben Stiller, Robin Williams, Carla Gugino, Dick Van Dyke, Mickey Rooney, Bill Cobbs (to which many remember for his appearance on "Demolition Man"), in this entertaining comedy debtor "Jumanji" or the more recent "Zathura".The Mizuo Peck actress, who plays the role of Sacagawea india has struck me especially, I don't know why, I think that that face will accompany us in the upcoming films that we are seeing on screen.I understand that the film has triumphed in the USA, it entertains from beginning to end, with an intense rhythm that does things happen in much of the footage, on the other hand, is welcome, presence, for my not always pleasant, Owen Wilson, and is, to this "tiparraco" you have started to take some ojeriza by his stupid cut comediesalmost always by the same pattern.Is true that in this kind of movie one cannot ask for more than what appears on screen, entertainment, a script where things happen because yea, and the feeling that one had one evening, in his childhood where he played with similarly with Indians, Romans, tanks and dinosaurs.Finally, a more than pleasant comedy for a winter afternoon.</body>
