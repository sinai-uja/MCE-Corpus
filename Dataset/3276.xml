	<body>A couple of authors returned to join some time later to pegár is her style with HOWARD a new hero. The film was directed by some interpreters of serie b more Psicotónica of the time.MARIANNA HILL "Cage homeless" or ANITA FORD "the invasion of the bee Queen". We have a really estimable film with an absorbent soundtrack, very grim picture that provides high efficiency in a paused but perfectly developed with great violence underground footage.That nobody wait see guts high, here the shots go in other directions, it is a terror that moves more between psychological. The anguish is transmitted in every scene with great mastery.The ZOMBIES are different, already in the 1970s us is athletic, very fast, really less monstrous appearance but it is transmitted at the same time less likely to deal with them which leads the characters to feel trapped with almost similar intelligence beings.A film that attacks the subgenus from a perspective very different to the usual, auque their slowness sometimes can be exasperating. A 7.</body>
