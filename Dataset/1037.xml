	<body>We all know that one thing of many forms, can express even though it is imaginary. If one wants to teach you how life can be solved with a simple remote control, that is hateful Adam Sandler. I say hateful because none of his films I has fallen well, except for this, Click, directed by Frank Coraci. Perhaps it is not morally correct the this idea, that with a command solved you all the problems (as if the player had so many!). Well, the fact is that which in the end means you Coraci is to live life the best you can, taking advantage of every moment, though you of laziness, you have to do. It is clear that it is not a great film, those with a background totally hopeful and complex, not. Click is a comedy, or drama rather, come on, the two things (well mixed) Yes, it has a moral background, but it is that you see Adam Sandler and Kate Beckinsale in a cottage with garden and three children and come on, you do not think for a moment that is a serious film. And it is that neither could have been serious. Anyway, the film fulfils its duty and I repeat, knows how to perfectly combine dramatic situations with the comic. But we must also say, and is Coraci film is somewhat irregular. The script is not bad (look at these future sequences that appear at the end), or interpretations not (sobresaltando of Christopher Walken, that every day feel me more that does not know where it is), but shows too many topics and little credible scenes. In any case, not disappointed me at all. In short, a comedy-drama with touches (several...)(many) not at all bad fiction, but also no exception (good). It is without doubt, the best film made by Adam Sandler.</body>
