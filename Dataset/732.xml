	<body>Almost all the years start from scratch a low-budget film that no one had and which rises with the favor of the public and any nomination for the oscars. This year it seems that it is this role to "Little Miss Sunshine" (Little Miss Sunshine).The film tells the trip a somewhat problematic family has to perform in his van, to the youngest of the family in the competition of Miss Sunshine. "As in any good film, and this is, the physical journey will become to turn an inner journey that will make evolve the characters (some more than others) and will change the family forever.""Little Miss Sunshine" is the debut in the realization of films of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, successful directors of commercials and video clips. I can not devote better compliment that say that the film lacks the typical defects from managers of these artistic areas.In fact the realization is quite sober and relies mainly on a good and funny script and characters solidly defined and performed beautifully by the cast, formed by Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, Toni Collette, Steve Carell, Paul Dano and Abigail Breslin and that it would be difficult to point out any member. Thanks to them we laughed and were excited for the 100 minutes that lasts for the film.You might criticize you that some situations are something forced and your (voluntary) nature of small film and unpretentious. But, fortunately, the history of the cinema is full of good small films without pretensions, of those that we like to see a year after another. Time will tell if that is the final destination of "Little Miss Sunshine".</body>
