	<body>Why are so few Canadian films to our screens? As in the case of many other nationalities, it seems that they have to come backed by awards for release. "C.R.A.Z.Y", certainly not an exception: award to the best Canadian film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival and best Director and screenplay, among others, in the Festival of cinema of Gijón 2005. In any case, without being a masterpiece, is a film that is worth the trouble. He has the life of Zach, the fourth of five siblings, from his childhood through his youth and, incidentally, portrays the life of a family in the years 60 and 70. The protagonist's relationship with his father is one of the fundamental axes, marked by a repressed and not accepted homosexuality. Interestingly, this does not become the only theme of the movie, but that goes to appearing and disappearing in a natural way as Zach grows, without leaving aside why other aspects such as the evolution of his brothers. I liked this approach, because sexuality is a part of life, not the only one, and films dealing with sexual identity-related conflicts sometimes tend to focus on them and forget everything else. Among the negative aspects, I would stress that the characters of the brothers are quite stereotyped and that the tape there is you extra footage - personally, I think that the journey of the protagonist is totally unnecessary-. Among the positive, without doubt, the soundtrack. Therefore that: an interesting and entertaining - film that nobody thinks it is a dramón, because it is not in any way-though somewhat long, it is possible that lovers of the music and the icons especially enjoy. Oh, and C.R.A.Z.Y are the initials of the five brothers (ja, ja, but what ingenious are!).</body>
