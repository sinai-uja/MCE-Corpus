	<summary>Swicord uses Jane Austen to his debut as a film director.</summary>
	<body>Jane Austen, one of the leaders of the English literature, has been discovered as a real film Philo. His books have been the subject of several film and television adaptations. Even his own life has been a film last year, "Becoming Jane". On this occasion, doing something like that in his day did Stephen Daldry with "The hours", it's see how that wrote this author remains the same of existing at the time that in the 21st century. In fact, even it is based on a book, as the work of Daldry, who in this case wrote Karen Joy Fowler.Un reading club gathers five women and a man on the books of the writer. Each with his tragedies daily, parallel to the daily tragedies that Jane Austen wrote. And it is that human relationships are a universal theme by nature.A nice romantic comedy that makes the little from the point of view of the realization and that nor deeply explores the complexity of the different human characters shown. Characters somewhat stereotyped, interpreted with correction but without applause, by the chosen distribution.It is the directorial debut of Robin Swicord, who has already carved out a name as a writer. Yours are the scripts of Matilda, virtually magic, little women, or memoirs of a geisha. It is a correct debut and not skip any of the rules of the comedy-drama that is so well known Swicord, who also signed the script.A movie to enjoy a Sunday afternoon, but of which there is no wait no ponderous reflection or an innovative staging.</body>
