Filmed in thirty days with consecrated actors both rookies, tries to capture the present poor of the India within a society strongly clinging to its roots in the past, both culturally and in his fierce religion.Infidelity, marriage by arrangement, statutory, the parent-child relationship and above all the love they are portrayed with credibility and realism, stories well, although something pasteurized in tone, is believed to be in this case but looks for Hollywood and its so attractive that all market influences it and is, in these parts also. With striking scenes by the alien and with all the colorful of Hindu culture, with an excellent soundtrack that surprises in a comedia-dram√°tica that could define manners. The most salient are the characters well delineated, strong, being the high point and the nexus of family guy, played by Naseeruddin Shah, recently named best Indian actor.
