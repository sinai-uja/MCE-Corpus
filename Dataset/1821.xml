	<summary>How Carol Reed not needed to Orson Welles to get a small masterpiece.</summary>
	<body>Very good and funny movie of Carol Reed, a great director who unfairly has been relegated to a second-order, to believe for many years that his best film "the third man" was actually directed by Orson Welles, something only in a small part true. Before us is beautifully directed and performed.Alec Guinness is superb, the film has a wonderful scene, very good use of the Cinemascope release, with a beautiful black and white photography. Fine English humor that is intoxicating, and acerados dialogue and double-edged. In sum, a film where one is at all times with a smile on your mouth, when not with the grateful laughter. If you have the opportunity to see this little masterpiece, Miss it will be a very bad idea.</body>
