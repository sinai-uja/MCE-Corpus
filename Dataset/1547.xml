	<body>It is highly likely that if you have the minimum degree of common sense to see this documentary is one of the more frightening possible and is also highly likely that once you finish seeing it a sense of helplessness fill your body; This important documentary for anyone who intends to continue living on the planet is 85% enriching information and 15% political propaganda and although some annoy to this last point indeed is that An Inconvenient Truth is a great documentary, deservedly winning the Oscar for best documentary for a couple of days.For those who don't know Al Gore was Vice President of USA during the Bill Clinton administration and presidential candidate for the Democrats was closely defeated by George W Bush in a controversial election that still causes controversy, the rest of the story because you know as well that Gore is a much more charismatic than the monigote to even hold the Presidency of that country.Now Gore has devoted itself to give lectures around the world to bring about awareness of the climate change product of human pollution and this documentary is basically the presentation of this Conference combined with elements of life itself of Gore; as regards the first point the documentary features pretty educational as the main points of the problem as well as knock down many myths that surround it.However it is the introduction of passages from the life of Gore be uncomfortable even though they are not too shocking in the context of the documentary and does not preclude that the educational content of this is highly valuable. Four star and is on DVD.</body>
