	<body>I am highly disappointed by the publicists of the shadow of the Kingdom. Look to one that is very yours decided not to read anything from this film why that takes a considerable delay of release since it was shot because the Americans should consider her the sea of controversial. And how to live in ignorance is bad the only reference were posters of the same show gentlemen (and Mrs) with their submachine guns and face of killing many poor Arabs. And say, cone, one of war, how well, hour and three quarters of war film. And when sales give you wanted to write to the dealership to tell them that at Spain we know to differentiate between the war film and the terrorist. Quote verbatim the synopsis of the production company although I disagree with it: A group of American officers moving to Riyadh to capture the brain from the lethal terrorist attack that cost the lives of several countrymen stationed at Saudi Arabia. The team will have one week to infiltrate and destroy a terrorist cell decided to wage "Jihad" against the Western society.In other words, Americans, I welcome with alegriaaaa. No, nor much less, the Americans are no longer fashion in the East. I have no very clear if they intended to make a film of anti-war dyes, a political pamphlet or send a message but if we are positioned before it as action movie is much more practical and enjoyable as fact that finally offers to part of a couple of philosophical reflections on how bad the war, how bad are terrorists and that both sides believe to have the ultimate of its part truth has sufficient shrapnel for be a correct and even entertaining thriller of action cinema.</body>
