	<body>Agent 47 is a weapon kill trained since childhood to be the best assassin. In his last Commission, something seems to have gone wrong and his shot white reappears while he becomes the person more search Russia and average Europa.Hitman is a succession of scenes of action, gunfights and quite aburridillas persecutions that have above that whiff to wanting to be a good script which makes it even more despicable. But as the action is to consume it with popcorn not can throw overland addicted to the film adaptations viewers video games (Yes, another one). And the truth is within the bad even entertaining. Half naked beautiful girls, many truncheons and a scene of action every quarter of an hour. Meets basic standards of the genre at foot juntillas. Let's be honest, a person who buys a ticket to see a movie in which leaves a bald mazado guy with two trabucones does not expect to see a tape of nouvelle Jaja, and I guess that the intricate turns of script are not either their primary objectives so it is going to throw two hours demanding that people die of entertaining and violent ways without give him a shred of creativity. and who has not wanted to one time see a flat to entertain movie which cast the first stone against happy spectators who come to the Hall to see Hitman and potentials. They enjoy.</body>
