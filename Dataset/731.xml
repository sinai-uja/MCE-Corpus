	<summary>Eschatological and absurd humor for this kind of nonsense Phanes. Those looking for cultured and intelligent humor that does not pass through here.</summary>
	<body>The truth is, commercially, the poster is shit. On the one hand, the five characters not hooked, the slogan is worthless for anything and these letters seem very cheap comedy. And if you believe that everyone has seen the one, are very wrong (damn, is that it is the 94). So it could have been something more currado the poster advertising, right?The film is about two friends, one journal and silly and somewhat wiser friend, working in a store for those who have everything. For things that do not come to the case, leave the work and get into a burger bar to work. The wise has a girlfriend with giant clitoris (like a small cock, joke of the film) and the other simply breathe by that has lungs. And make nonsense, they talk about crap until at the end is termina.¿Que what I think? Because the truth is that the principle seemed to me very bad, given that not him he got the wave to the argument. Later, when I I made sure there was no argument, I I relajé and laughed a lot with some scenes. In particular that of the Lord of the rings and the donkey. And as I have not seen the first, I came because everything new. It is certainly a very particular and offensive humor with conversations that may be unpleasant (such as the ass mouth) but I felt like a marrano in a puddle, the truth.In short, eschatological and absurd humor for this kind of nonsense Phanes. Those looking for cultured and intelligent humor that does not pass through here. I thought I meaba with a scene at the end.</body>
