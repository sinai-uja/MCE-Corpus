	<summary>Curious is that in Spain, a country where soccer moves more money than any other sport, do more movies based (or supported), but it is also true that if all the tapes that versin on football will be like this... Shuts down and we Let's go</summary>
	<body>Now is the part where I would have to say typical, already worth you Spanish film, always the same, and that bla bla bla, as I always say this and it hurts the mouth of repeating it, will try to avoid the subject and go directly to give my opinion on the ill-fated film, where neither Willy Toledo, an actor that I like quite badboth in film and in person (and Yes, I know him in person), or Javier Guti√©rrez (which had bad concept until I saw him in "The room of the child" by Alex de la Iglesia), manage to shine; nor Lydia Navarro, which I I I have thrown all the footage thinking where had seen and he was in the adaptation of "Closer" to the theatre in Madrid together with Bethlehem Rueda.Es curious that in Spain, a country where soccer moves more money than any other sport, is not more movies based (or supported), but it is also true that if all the tapes that versin on football will be like this. Turn off and let's go, or the script (simple and very weak), nor the plot (simple and loose also), or actions (sobreactuado Toledo, loose Gutierrez) not even the "party" supposed that provide the main character (or the Recre was going to UEFA, the Valencia won the League, nor the players are the authentic.)they never engage the audience.On the other hand the tape is repetitive with so much music in its soundtrack, over and over again pretending, so sound the tape seems funny and great.It is true that should be more tapes on football as amateur I am find it me curious, but please, with something more serious, or at least with a fresh and surprising argument okay?</body>
