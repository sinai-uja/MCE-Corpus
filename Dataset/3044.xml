	<body>I spend it pump with Diabolik! In 1968, Mario Bava directed this adaptation of the character, a classic of the Italian comic of the 1960s.John Phillip Law is Diabolik, thief and criminal (terrorist) with the eyebrows on the planet coolest and Marisa Mell is Eva, the most stunning woman I've seen in a movie in a long time. Michel Piccoli is Inspector Ginko, the man who must catch the masked thief.But that won't be easy: Diabolik has all kinds of gadgets and that most caught my attention were the "laughing Gas" and the "morning-after pill Anti-laughing gas" which I guess they come in the same pack.The soundtrack is Ennio Morricone and the rhythm is great although the movie has no feet or head and appear three episodes of a television series.Young pop drogatas of the sixty-one exemplary travelling on a Canute are more ingredients for the salad of eccentricities that would delight many if Grindhouse makers resurrect the history instead of Barbarella.Los first 25' are great. I want to be Diabolik.</body>
