	<body>There is much of that laugh, but also cagadas unnecessary, literally. There are good gags. But also others, such as fight naked and break things, who dedicated much time when the truth do not have nothing again, then my particularly, do not give me much laughter. But the rest of the time makes you laugh things that you'd never think you reirías. Politically correct? is not.Baron Cohen agrees with his character till the last consequences. It has to do because most of the times only has a decision-making and otherwise would not work. The film is a pseudo documentary, or rather a parody of the documentary. But it also has a narrative fiction, but somewhat is loose.Try to offend many. Jews, women, homosexuals, conservative, homophobic. It is as if he wanted to cancel go against a group, going against all criticism. It works. Persons who confronts Borat really take the worst of if same, but there are times that they are innocent. As Pamela (Yes, the watchers of the beach). You would never think I alinearía to defend it, but what did it seemed really cruel. Actually just her I mention it because otherwise he would have to tell more of the film, and being a film of jokes, it is better to not advance anything. That if, if you suffer from pena-ajena, suffer much.See the advertising of Borat in the metro is really refreshing. Among the usual advertising bad taste almost always highlight film posters, but Borat's has. Bad taste with desire. And that is appreciated between posters who do not dare are increasingly similar.For my the bad taste that I left the movie happens whatever I laughed, glad to have her seen but I would not dare to recommend.</body>
