	<body>Without a doubt we are before one of those movies with true Costner, Hurt, renowned actors Moore. It will delight lovers of film and that however and after a promising start it is diluted as a spoonful in hot coffee.Let us not deceive ourselves, are dealing with a well built, well filmed tape and bebe a diversity so great sources that surprise the most painted, too bad that that diversity makes the tape a disservice, since, while the home is promising, in the end stays on a laughable belt, some stupid comicamente moments and wherein spite of trying to give the script not 1, but 2 laps of script, makes water always and at all times.It is curious as the villain at the beginning of the tape is hero and villain heroin and attempting to change the roles that one is not more than put face of cousin and concur, over and over again with such great and at the same time embarrassing circus quasi so many times (more difficult still).The direction of Bruce a. Evans, respected writer ("Count on me", "Starman" and "Cutthroat island".), here debuts in address work looks more like one of those "commissioned" works where the director is not more than a mere figurehead or man of straw, that endures est√≥icamente shower, placing both Costner and Demi Moore, in the best moments on screen and holding the pull of what is approaching, in this script is also fruit of Evans and stays "middle piston" hoping to be that which had to be and was not.Highlight in addition to those already listed 2 television, Danielle Panabaker (as daughter of the protagonist that we now see in the series "Shark" as a daughter of James Woods) and the mythical-CSI Las vegas Marg Helgenberger.Resumiendo and still concise, an I want to and can't film it reaches Spain 5 months too late (in the USA release was in July).</body>
