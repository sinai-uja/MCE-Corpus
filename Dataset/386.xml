	<summary>A rollercoaster of laughs that leave no one indifferent. Smith once again masterfully by where they came with a debtor of his previous film tape, dazzles fun and leaves very good taste.</summary>
	<body>More than curious that in my last week of Bachelor, the first film that I am going in a press (Deaplaneta thanks for your patience) pass, closely concerned the issue of marriage, by Dante, with his girlfriend's life, and its Solomonic decision.After the note than anything it has to do with the topic, but if I do not say I bust, I still return characters created by writer / director Kevin Smith; both Dante and Randal, as those who for me are the flagship of Smith, Jay &amp; Bob the silent (the Smith).The tape, a sum inmesa of gags, that start from the first minute of projection until the last second, a rollercoaster of laughs that leave no one indifferent, so far, Smith remains in line with this tape, leaving aside the bland "Jersey Girl" taking its point geek, álguido and culminating in the dialogue of Randal about Star Wars and the Lord of the rings, as well as authorship of Kevin Smith captured in one of his characters (which has cost him the poor assume that it is no longer a chavalín-Geek of the comics, despite being the owner of 2 stores so succulent material).Ultimately, Smith once again masterfully by where they came with a debtor of his previous film tape, dazzles, fun and leaves very good taste, go, one hour and 35 minutes. good employees.</body>
