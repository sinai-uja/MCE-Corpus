	<summary>Allegedly critical against the system and, in reality, tendentious and devious.</summary>
	<body>Entertaining action film, albeit a great fantasmada. To pass the time by seeing it must forget any hint of plausibility in the diverse and rather ridiculous events that are happening without more nor more, than rather hastily and lengthening the film to unfortunate ends. It begins well, with a good prologue and until the first half-hour action holds thanks to a flexible mounting. However, shortly after they begin the inconsistencies, tomaduras of hair (the way in which take out you the bullet and he himself heals, until that time, the wounds.), and the dialogues become ridiculous.Everything is nonsense and is derived to dangerous even in its fund approaches, to be untargeted alleged Puya to incorrect actions of the Government of the United States, as when we say that "Yes, it is true, as there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.".But in the end it is discovered that when the law fails, by its legal system, be done justice by own hand, Justice derived towards the murder, even if it is the bad bad function. Something disgusting indicating well clearly the true intentions which houses the film.Devious and pendencioso over not being able, though narrated effectively by Fuqua, whose film career going at high speed grounding of video club, if he does not walk with care.Finally, you can spend the time watching this bullshit where the good do not fail a single shot and them already can pull you up missiles, that is hardly inmutan, but is tendentious and ends in a rather embarrassing way, with an epilogue of night court.</body>
