	<body>Well, sorry for my dear readers these days since the release have been very moviditos and I have not had time to get me to write, but here I am again. Let's talk about ultraviolet for those who do not know is the last crappy, I say. Mila Jovochich (5th element) film.What surprised me most of the film is the theme, I think we were all checked, no one imagined that the thing was victimized vampire. Ultraviolet is Ultramala, for some time that did not see something like this (from the Avengers of UMA THURMAN) and Mila we love, we love, is very good, is wonderful, it has surpassed as an actress, if, and if, we know, but fuck, I, this humble servant wants to know why all his films have "Crappy Danger" label on the cover. This girl could take you more advantage of interpretative, but extremely beautiful and as now claro.es takes the vulgarity only offer shit scripts.Plays will end up as Charlize Ther√≥n, having to produce their own movie (Monster) so they respect as an actress and have option to Oscar which in fact was (well deserved).In ultraviolet, is pathetic todo.frases, subliminal insults the Viewer, pathetic interpretations (clear with that script), inconsistencies in the story, the list is very long.If I have to admit that the production and effects both the fighting and the action scenes melee are phenomenal, this Yes.But. My God the dash is bad it is awful, I have no words, be careful if you are going to see her not going to suffer a cerebral aneurysm with phrases so master as "Come from a world that you can understand not perhaps".that horror! The soundtrack of The Cramberrys XDGenial.</body>
