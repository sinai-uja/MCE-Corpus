	<summary>Extraordinary comedy that has transcended the ages with Marilyn or without it.</summary>
	<body>This popular Comedy Hollywood gave one of his most emblematic images: Marilyn Monroe wearing its legs in Cinemascope as a result of a mischievous air. Curiously this appearance, the most trumpeted the tape, was vetoed by the censorship by what she was not seen by its early viewers. Anyway, they enjoyed an extraordinary comedy that has transcended the ages with Marilyn or without it. Richard Sherman is a married man who spends a summer in solitude while his wife and son out of holiday. The scrupulous but imaginative Sherman wants to behave well and spend the days quietly, until he meets his new neighbor, irresistible Monroe. Sherman suffers from the delicious torment of staying true to such temptation. More funny monologues that Billy Wilder has written: the superyo and the dreamy side of Sherman faced constantly, away or towards its neighbour to attract it more and more in love with him. In this film, Wilder slips a commentary on the institution of marriage at that time and their brittle longing to be unbreakable.</body>
