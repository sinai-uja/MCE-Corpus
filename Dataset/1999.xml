	<body>Francois Ozon French has everything to become a controversial director: ignored by critics of his country (unclassifiable according to them), a voluble and uneven work until almost marginal, and if was bit, avowed homosexual. What is the true Ozon? Do of the interesting Sitcom, Regarde la mer or the empty 8 women?.The pool is on the other hand, all virtues. It is an amalgam that mixes the best of its director. Slow, slowly but without potholes as almost all of the French film, a thriller intelligent without getting to exclude the public, with a hook in the form of final twist - dreams - not annoying and only makes reaffirm all narrated, where other directors fail miserably.Holidays of a writer (saturated, prudish and amoral as it is Sarah) and their holiday at a weekend home, are the pretext for confrontation with Julie, the daughter of his publisher (spirited, also amoral and unprejudiced) and the meeting of things lost in your life - or never found - as the desire, freedom and sex.Excellent all stakeholders, mainly the female roles: the great Charlotte Rampling (old Filmography of the director known) with a beautiful naked included to its more than sixty years. Las palmas them takes the provocative Ludivine Sagnier, who guides the story with their audacity and beauty. We'll see if its next move, Ozon reveals your true being.</body>
