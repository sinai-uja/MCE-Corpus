	<summary>Finally, 100% tape Burton to as Spielberg "a.i." is a good piece of footage.</summary>
	<body>He even had fresh memories of "A world of fantasy" which starred Gene Wilder and not long ago I saw DivX overnight comfortably on the couch at home, they said that the Burton film was more faithful to the book of what was this film of 1971, although once I saw the only remake I can say that the original I liked much moreIt is true that in this musical numbers are only conducted the Oompa Loompas and that the previous "he sang until the pointer", however, this one film arrives almost drowned before both spirit Burton (the film is 100% Tim Burton) and it is even easy to find references ranging from "Planet of the apes" passing by "Nightmare before Christmas" and even "Edward Scissorhands" (this last more than anything by the Danny Elfman Score)(, that is with Burton a binomino inseparable).It is true that the movie is a plea to this fantasy world created by Roald Dahl (I recommend to keep an eye on the book) but. Not arrive to the feeling that the tape can spare you almost 15 min.? Perhaps I'm making more. (Cachis).Finally, 100% tape Burton to as Spielberg "a.i." is a good piece of footage.</body>
