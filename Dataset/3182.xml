	<body>Yesterday ended the Sitges festival with the film 1408, which promised much but that ended up being a failed attempt to deepen the descents to hell of its protagonist. A writer is dedicated to travel and write about various scenarios where there are supposedly ghosts, but never find any indication of this. Room 1408 in a New York hotel will be your next challenge, but what will live there will have nothing to do with its failed previous experiences and room will be turning into a nightmare from which they can escape. Another adaptation of author Stephen King, which although isn't entirely bad, if that ends up being a film with a good base missed and a journey of insanity just for not being so. The film proposes a character to which room ira undergoing tough tests to collapse it, strange, Ghost events from the past that will make his appearance, heat, intense cold, no possibility of escape, everything is fine but fails at any time transmit to the viewer the feeling of tension, claustrophobia and fear of should even make the mistake of let some other fright helpings which not is beside the point. It can be seen, but one expected something more from one film that promised to be at the head of the terror of this year.One more year, in beyond of Orion, I tried to follow a more precise as possible to the festival and everything that I've been watching, commenting on each film as best as possible and giving my humble opinion that I hope you have served for at least have a reference, then we coincidiremos or not, but that is another sing.</body>
