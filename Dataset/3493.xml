	<summary>Good film from the same creator as "Heidi" and "Framework", but completely different in its immense drama.</summary>
	<body>Drama of father and very Mr. mine, too away from the animated film for children, to the point of being qualified for over thirteen years.It is made by the same man that he entertained us (and also quite empachó), being children (who have certain years, clear) with "Heidi" and "Framework", but the spirit of the film is completely different, at least in your background.It is thus the extreme living conditions of some human beings in need of all, during the world war, are exposed in a clear and tough. With scraps of poetry and lyricism, such as the scene in which the two brothers provide light arising fireflies at night, inside the shelter in which are installed, but not save scenes of high drama.The drawings are precious although there is that statism in the distant strokes, so common to Japanese animation. But the dialogues are successful and various avatars are the two main characters are exposed with singular clarity, using for this right, paused, but never slow pace.Nice music and great sadness that encompasses this cruel story, real as life itself.</body>
