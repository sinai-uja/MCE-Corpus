	<body>The girlfriend of a young medical student dies in a ridiculous crash with a lawn mower. The boy, afflicted, keeps his head in the hope to restore life someday. To do this you will need a new body and what better way to get pieces that women who sell their bodies?The formula is simple: "Frankenhooker" = "Re-Animator" + "The bride of Frankenstein" + "An explosive girl" + touch Henenlotter, director of "Basket Case".Undoubtedly the most successful of the film is its fine (or thick, as you look at it) black humor, seasoned with a touch of ochentera teen comedy. If we also add the mark of the House of the director, the result is little more than curious. The screen will see parade scenes as mad as the of the "putas-bomba", the process of selection of the raw materials or the healthy hobby that Frank has to relax: drilling head (there be donkey). However, among all of them stands out the rebuscadísimo final, so bizarre, so "stories from the crypt", you have to laugh, and in which looms the shadow of "Baseket Case". Even the pobrísimos special effects manage to spoil some scenes born to skip fillings. It is a pity that by a desire to reach a greater audience will spare both in hemoglobin. I am sure that with a little more than "substance" the film would become possibly a small Classic at the same level that the opera prima of the director.Little comment should more be in a movie as simple and modest intentions like this. And as usually happens in the end are the simplest to more effectively manage: fun.</body>
