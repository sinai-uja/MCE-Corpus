	<summary>Paradoxically, the cry 2 is the culmination of the process of Americanization that in recent years has been subjecting Hollywood to the Japanese horror film, which had been used as a desperate measure to the ideological exhaustion of his vulgar but prolific writers.</summary>
	<body>Americans aware of weary that becomes your typical teen horror film, have been proposed in other parts of the world to find new forms, new ideas, new concepts into his worn out machinery. At the end gave with what he wanted, and did so on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. Japanese horror cinema became the new fashion of the big studios. Early adaptations made success in the Japanese country films were fairly reliable, and achieved a success notable (remember, for example, the signal). Later, and with that nationalist incontinence that characterizes the first world power, were progressively, Americanized scripts, frames, the tempos and if neglected, to the very same Takashi Shimizu, director and filmmaker of the original versions and head of the shot to the West. In the end, the result is that they have achieved that new versions of Japanese films do not differ overly from genuinely American products, and that has been largely lost the freshness, the ability to surprise and hit, and above all, the characteristic and the Asian giant's own ambience. Is why cry 2 is a terrible film, in which the picture is mediocre, interpretations, saving Sarah Michelle Gellar, poor, and repetitive special effects. This cluster of absurdities joins an almost non-existent soundtrack and when it appears does so only to alert you that something is going to happen in the next few seconds, thus depriving the viewer of the few upsets that per this new nonsense of Hollywood industry could cause.
