	<body>If we could describe the movie in a few words would say that we we have a modern classic.The director and his two writers (the quoted Paul Haggis and a Japanese, Iris Yamashita, based on the correspondence of general Tadamichi Kuribayashi) turn the film into a moral and physical experience (claustrophobic) at the same time, that show the calvary of thousands of Japanese soldiers who, knowing of his military inferiority - waited for long hours the enemy confined in caves and trenches dug by them in full mountain.His eyes wide and inclusive, Eastwood describes the experiences from four well various angles: two common soldiers as noble Baker Saigo (pop star Kazunari Ninomiya) and the maverick Shimizu (Ryo Kase); Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), an aristocrat who knew how to be Olympic champion in riding and personal friend of Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks, and lieutenant general Tadamichi Kuribayashi (excellent interpretation by Ken Watanabe), the character more rich in nuances of the film.His story is eloquent to show illogical extremes of war, along with an elegant language and intelligent management of the pace.Mercy, the fear, the honor and cowardice, repulsion and madness are latent in every scene, with a photograph of the documentary record of the time of Tom Stern that becomes realistic, with its 80th colors.It unravels the Japanese with unusual psychological complexity; naked them in his courage, in its violence, ancestral named, on their fears, their curiosity, in his goodness and even in a surprising tenderness.It is a simple story that has foregone all the clichés and moralisms that suffers the war genre. Us shivers realizing the falsity of the war and how it generates differences and non-existent barriers between humans so intimately.Eastwood polls the atmosphere of Iwo Jima since Japanese soldiers fortifican her until that they defend and, ultimately, lose as they also lost their lives.In battles, except on rare occasions, never the opposite side, we see that the director just trying to show the personal consequences on the side of which we are witnesses of the facts.It was in "The conquest of honour", but much more cruel, more direct, more terrible.Eastwood links these sequences with long conversations between the soldiers and the memories of each one, without decline interest nor an only moment.The head is very intelligent in its treatment, because, on the one hand, shows the Japanese in various acts of courage and cowardice, but at the same time, makes it very clear, respectful but implacable, so that something did not work well in their military culture.The film works perfectly if same, without having seen "Flags of our fathers", although obviously you can see its Parallels.Seen as a whole, the two films are complemented to draw that line, so thin and capricious but at the same time as defined in the war separates the winners from the losers, the dead of alive. "Letters from Iwo Jima" is a film about the feelings.It is a mural tragic but complete instructive that highlights everything that humans can feel when it is subjected to the irrationality and stupidity.And the manifestation of this orgullo-honor becomes a form of social integration that generates a culture of belonging to whatever, race, religion, nation or all of them and that aligns to the individuals giving them a shared identity.That fit where patria, race, religion, faith and commitment to the extent that makes us happy and gives us peace of mind.Surely there is not another thing that recognize the alien space and identify the enemy by the name that reads in your mailbox.If we do, it is possible to see that the supposed enemy is another neighbor who, like us, probably also expected letter.And the question that should be is: If humanity has always suffered the horror of the war, if it is not a solution or an outlet to a conflict between men, is why reincidimos?If history serves the purpose that people learn not to commit the same mistakes, why we insist?For Clint Eastwood war is a single, and there is no good or bad, or if any, the same found in one and another side.</body>
