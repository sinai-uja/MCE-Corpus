	<body>Sensing already the potential narrative could have the new attacks in this 21st century, March 11 witnesses referred to mobile terminals that continued playing on the side of corpses as a magical realism of García Márquez more bleak. On 11 September, the 11-M matrix, deserved before appropriating copyright of these stories. World Trade Center already adds the second film about the 11-S, but this is the first involving a speech, a direct response.World Trade Center shares with United 93 intuition that what happened can not understand in a single story, and before that is limited from its approach to a vantage point: the debris of the twin towers. The cinema of catastrophes, the Chronicle however objective, Elliptically narrated snapshots are not there, and instead subliman in the form of family tragedy, of exemplary family tragedy. The two characters in the film do not offer even different perspectives of the same event, unlike the scheme is repeated mimetically in both; as only had another possible answer. Good, if any, of the marine; a real character that seems however impostado in final assembly. Stone may think that it is a good documentary which only tells the truth, but far from it, should remember that instead it is telling us what he thinks he should or at least it should have been that day.</body>
