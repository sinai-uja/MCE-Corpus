	<summary>Maybe is not, at the bottom of any allegation against the war and their hatred but an exercise of cinematic textures, as a kind of collage of formats, on the way, giving a blow at the table of the teletypes.</summary>
	<body>Brian de Palma has curioseado on the Internet and found material to mount a burning movie of compromise, denouncing the wars in general and the Iraq war in particular with the reconstruction of the rape and murder of a young girl and her family at the hands of a group of U.S. soldiers in Mamoudiyah, a village near Baghdad. Away from the discursive asepsis of Robert Redford in his recent Lions for Lambs, De Palma unreported to the wars the alum a politician neocom with broadband in the blackberry and high ideals of Pocket Bible. Yours is (has been) making films with a minimum of life, films lovingly installed in entertainment, in the respectful tribute to the teachers who encouraged him to take a camera (Peckinpah, Hitchcock) and give us visual euphoria. Here it away from what we might expect from their house brand and addresses adolescent enthusiastically even wounds that have not yet lacerado the skin of the always innocent votive offerings of the battles and the wounds of the conflict, wounded by cauterize. The problem is that he acquires limited commitments with the image and loads of political thesis, pure activism. To translate this drama not used actors but archetypes.What account Redacted is not the spoliation of the war: his vocation is to stoke up image uncomfortable to the Viewer so it reasons the madness of the conflict and understand that beyond commercial Hollywood steamroller, the film occasionally can give rise to intelligent dialogue and remover, that they sometimes anquilosan and ideas do not fall at the blast of the decision-making positions and media manipulation to which subjected the criterion of who they do not consent information to flow without the interference of their interests.Cold: Redacted is a cold, meaningless allegation of emotions. The fact that reality can be configured at the whim of ideologies and cabinets of crisis or marketing is not a new matter in the film. Images require an ethic. The erstwhile aesthetic audacity to De Palma is here reduced to a documentalism soulless, excessively burdened by the modernity of the formats that seek the iconic content (mobile, youtube, infrared, photo montages, websites, security cameras.) All that is added formidably mounted on the tape, but cinema is also a novel issue, which needs the beauties of fiction and Redacted is a distorted testimony raised on a real event, but lev√≠simamente built on emotions that real fact produce in those who dramatized. Almost nothing to the director not plasmase, with more fortune, in hearts of iron, tape twinned to this and current claiming following replies wars taken to striked blushing and shame of peoples. Before Viet Nam; now, Iraq. Brian de Palma, exceptional creator of dreams, is a filmmaker more akin to the fireworks of fireworks that encouraged the birth of the seventh art that instrospectivo travelling from who, camera on his shoulder, aims to capture the essence Poetics of the flight of a Nightingale or the depictions of the human soul. Without being rude, the gaze of De Palma not qualifies. This mock aware film speaks to two bands: the box office, which is lost, and criticism, which will cover this effort as a political or social to strictly film outburst, banked to the agitation of the voter (that is the story, almost is none other) that take care of form and content and check in a product of greater height.</body>
