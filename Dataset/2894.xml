	<body>In 1988 John McTiernan directed a movie of action had a prota with charisma and sense of humor, something that does not then abounded (does now if?) which if we look at Billboard's then fellow finds Seagal (above the law), Van Damme (bloody contact) or the uncle of Crocodile Dundee; also there were major gifts such as doll DiabólicoA fish called Wanda or Cocktail.La jungle of Crystal presented a poly with very bad host and problems at home in a skyscraper full of very bloody foreign terrorists and the feet small. What should not do Tarantino with McClaine toes?The poly makes the threat with effort, sweat, blood, ultraviolence, and plastic explosive. The bad guys were attributable to Hans Gruber, a guy that reminds the Sheriff of Nottingham and is coolto of balls. Hand will not tremble you to count up to three and popping the head of the head of Holly Gennero. Sorry John. 9.</body>
