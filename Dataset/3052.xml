	<body>Antonio Mercero had a major success with plant 4 reflecting the theme of cancer alluding to the easy tear in pursuit of a caramel commercialism. In this type of product can be addressed in two ways.Looking for the truth or simply offering a dramon of volume and lomo type movie with famous actors to engage in the box office.Unfortunately mercero again relapse in the subject in the same way, brilliant interpretations of López Vázquez and Manuel Alexandre is expected from interpreters with quality proven over the years getting roles for the personal showcasing slice.We are faced with a cheater film where everything is surface without lower interest dramatic nor contributing anything positive to a serious case.Then they will tell you that it is a film with good intentions, but that's not enough to make good movies.</body>
