	<body>'Rocky Balboa' ends up being the best and most emotional episode of the entire series. Despite the slow (although charmingly nostalgic) it becomes for its first hour, rhythm sticks a rush in all directions from the already mitiquísima sequence of training, to the rhythm of "Gonna fly now". Then Stallone grows and gives us some of the best boxing of the history of the film sequences, experimenting with the camera and photography, to trigger in the best, most emotional and most dignified end the saga of 'Rocky' might have. A true love letter, written to own handwriting and with love for all the rockymaníacos, which are not (we are) few.Although clear, if you haven't seen the predecessors (the appalling 'IV' and 'V' included), little will tell you this movie, where the nostalgic element is vital.</body>
