	<body>Dan Evans (Christian Bale), which is stiff pasta decides to volunteering to deliver to the dangerous outlaw Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), the objective is to be on time on the train from 3: 10 that will take him to prison in Yuma but members of his band is not going to be easy.Now am going to recognize my illiteracy and despite having seen much Western classic never saw the 1957 version with Glenn Ford. Rain of tomatoes for me, rectificaré, I have it on the list of things to do. Without knowing the original say that Yuma 3:10To, still no official date of premiere in Spain) is a little slow.A two-hour movie based on two shootings can do. There is no way to unite a footage so beast with so little action. It is a good film in the West, it has all the elements to be, has good actors, good script, some nice secondary but focuses both on the figure of Ben Wade that sometimes or with great effort can steal a scene Crowe. Christian Bale (between Batmans seen you very desmejorado) nor of Ben Foster (who me resembles strangely Vincent Cassell of Blueberry) give the replica and work well. Perhaps that is what saves the tape, its director James Mangold knows do their job and made the film with efectivismo and precision without any error to attribute that technically and visually it is perfect.Much I have read about the resurgence of the genre thanks to the not inconsiderable box office of this tape. But I do not think that he repeated the success in Europe and I do not think that a public accustomed to rapid consumption cinema is ready to return to films of the fifties/sixties but that only time will tell.</body>
