	<body>Despite their ups and downs of rhythm and some sequences that contribute little to the argument (but a lot fun) as seals or killer whales almost to the end of the film, 'Happy Feet' has fascinated me from beginning to end.For the first time in an animated film, I forgot while he saw that it was just an animated film. I have forgotten to fully concentrate on how it was the script and other gilipolladas which only more Geek-lovers as I or those who read me pay attention, so I simply spent big, have left me carried away by these penguins so perfectly well recreated, and her have enjoyed as the smallest child: from the Warner Bros. logo. until the last of the closing credits.And I appreciate that. A lot. A surprise and a breath of cool air (never better said) that is eternally appreciated in these times of green ogres throwing farting and burping and several plagiarism between studies. And above with a fucking great environmentalist message.</body>
