	<summary>The Woody Allen film can be seen as an invention or a transcript of his own private life. The two options are equally entertaining.</summary>
	<body>The couple of amateur detectives is taken from "Manhattan murder mystery", the fantastic appearance of the sparing is equal the coryphaeus of "Powerful Aphrodite", the somewhat reckless character of Scarlett Johansson is the same reckless role that made before the Mia Farrow or Diane Keaton or so many others. The character of Allen is the same anti-hero who has always played. The heroines of Allen have to fight against the bad guys and above all, the timidity of a hipocondr√≠aco player that never steal them a medal. Allen has a drawer of endless tailor you can get thousands of things. His films can be seen as an invention or a transcript of his own private life. The two options are equally entertaining. Seeing the way they got with the girl I came to the conclusion that Johansson is less self-worshiping that some of his other muses.Scoop is an apprentice journalist which has the scoop of the century in his hands if it can demonstrate that an English nobleman is also a notorious serial killer. "To investigate what strain in his life and in his bed, so just falling for him.""Scoop", like "Match Point" works as a watch mechanism. The same applies to a history of Billy Wilder, in these works, no sentence is casual, a nail in the first act serves to discover the murderer in the third. It is a way of writing that work makes it easier to. One has to fill straw many minutes of film, information, ICTs, pasts of the characters, weaknesses, repetitions. If he picks up randomly, can do something very nice, but free, or worse still, autobiographical. If every detail is used to tie knots at the end, one passes very well sow the dialogues of tracks. And the viewer doesn't get tired of thank you.</body>
