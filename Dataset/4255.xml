	<body>Already have one of the most anticipated releases produced by the new King midas creator J.J. ABRAMS of several successful industry as lost television or NICKNAME between others and director of the third part of mission impossible.In the direction Debuts his friend MATT REEVES in the field of the feature although long television career either in the field of the script or address in various chapters of FELICITY among so many others.The protagonists are also young faces recognized on the small screen not too popular to slowly try to make their way.Maybe MIKE VOGEL is the more name thanks to the success which saw the massacre of Texas 2003 accompanied by many good looking girls.Obviously the interpretations in a product of these features is the least, little juice will be drawn as flat characters where the most important thing is the appearance of the monster in question and their special effects. Not find anything when I say that this is a cross between the pseudo documentary format lately very exploited REC or diary of the dead and a Monster movie GODZILLA type.Experiment salda of irregular shape, some effects are actually achieved, with a good pace that serves to entertain without fanfare, on the other hand almost the story is non-existent in all aspects. His promotion to bases of Internet that reminds the Witch of blair for his secrecy is one of its great strengths to achieve box office success.Whatever is passes an entertaining and very accomplished moments while fulfilling its mission.</body>
