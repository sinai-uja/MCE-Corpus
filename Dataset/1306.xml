	<summary>Apocalypto is an action-adventure movie that turns to topics that seemed forgotten.</summary>
	<body>Says George Lucas in connection with the Supercine of time roll Cecil B. De Mille in the documentary of fashion blogs, A Personal Journey with Martin Scorsese Through American Movies than anyone currently do a sequence with two thousand extras taking technological advances that has American cinema.And I say: let us hope a couple of movies more than Mel.Apocalypto is an action film. As cornered, like predator or as a lethal weapon. It is very well shot, it of course (it was already for my higher the passion of the Christ) and has moments of wonderful stealth film.But is a movie action-adventure that turns to topics that seemed forgotten (the waterfall of the fugitive.) and modern theatrics of the type "time announcement of Pirelli" (Ronaldinho with jaguar behind.) the sea of entertaining.And it is a movie of author. I does not attract more than Marie Antoinette but if rather than flags of our fathers.PS: It may he suffer the syndrome of "all have already seen and say that it is fucking great" or that note interfere with the Lord that snoring lying!!!! in three seats with his wife (I got up, started them to stock and they largaron at the height of the attack of the village) or the MOM Disney who exclaimed Oooohhhh! every time that a child appeared on the screen. I exclaimed it everytime someone was destripado. And there are not so many. There is more blood in the back of James Caviezel as in the village of Jaguar Paw.</body>
