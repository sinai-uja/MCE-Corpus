	<summary>Film for more kids not too bored to parents. A sequel that improves more than the original.</summary>
	<body>Lately only us they reach screens sequels and prequels you of more or less successful films. Why do they not make new films? Man, one basic reason is that the publicity already have made. It is not the same having to announce the fat Orange first cat as it is a sequel to the first. More cheap, and also know that they have full movie theaters. Fortunately, in the case we are dealing with today, the sequel is much better than the original.The film is about two fat cats and oranges. One of them, lives in United States and lives with his "master" (in quotes) and a dog named Oddie puppy. The other lives in Britain and is the owner of a castle and an immense fortune. Of course not known, and more of course still mix their lives at any given time.I have to say that I liked the film and I laughed several times. The script is not original, but the smallest of the House tend to not be very critical in that regard. Situations that recreate are pretty well, making him grace even to older. The moment of truth farm animals is more than that for me it enough, but good. Human beings are very prototypical, with the bad very evil on par with silly, and the rest do not learn anything. And the special effects are very accomplished, only used with two cats, which seem more true that some farm animals.In short, film for more kids not too bored to parents. A sequel that improves more than the original.</body>
