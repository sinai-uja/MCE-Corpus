	<body>I declare I enthusiastic visionador type films Scary Movie. My medium Zucchini does not understand as our deuvedeteca covers each and every one of the movies of the saga, nor much less similar as the dwarf who poses as a baby. But look, it's a humor so absurd it makes me laugh. So waiting eagerly the release of Epic Movie, which promised to be more of the same. By God, you see, is not not like Scary Movie, nor is it even a film. It is a truñae truño.The film is about four orphaned treinteños who appear to be children of the same father, or what will I. Each comes from a different movie (snakes on the plane, Supernacho, X-men and the Da Vinci Code) and meets a stranger, Charlie and the chocolate factory, to reach Narnia. Once inside already this is a carajal gives me to shame continue summarizing.Truño, that great word and good sounds. Repeat with me, T - R - U - N - o. Truño is a word created many years ago, but sure that its creator created it only to define this truño. Do not have nor puta grace, removing some time in those that caught you off guard (the scene of the Beaver made me grace), but deadly bad. The characterizations of the films are very curradas and it seems that the thing had a huge budget, why not spend a few perricas in a nice script? He is making or with bias that had I to enlarge its virtues to say something good. Go truño.In short, truño of epic dimensions. There is no where on take it, except that it is small. If you think that has the slightest resemblance to Scary Movie, you have deceived. It is a truño in every sense of the word.Truñic Movie.Besitos.P.D: And at the end leaves Borat, what I was missing.</body>
