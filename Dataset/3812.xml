	<summary>An excellent French comedy that will delight all lovers of "Amelie" and other productions...</summary>
	<body>Lately in the French film I'm finding with real jewelry, small films made without great pretensions but always leave footprint, tapes as "The boys of the choir", "rivers of color purple" (which has nothing to raise to "code Da Vinci") or even "Amelie" belt with which it shares a kind of relationship and that, however (and luckily for my) have nothing to do; and is that to me this movie seems much more nice, simple and earthly to the Muse of Montmatre.Desde the first time one realizes that Odette (for my all an attractive Catherine Font discovery), is like any ordinary neighbor that we have at home, with its flaws and its virtues, with an innate joy by very bad that the go things, in addition to a great desire to live, and that injects the rest of characters that touch of optimism that the tape needs, and is that we we have the typical movie "deja Lees" and good taste a completion.It is true that the rest of the actors are normal for my all completely unknown (I have already said that I'm bit in cinema of the country neighbour.), although it is also true that they could learn in Spain to make films of this size, will perhaps be that French Cinema Act works and that of Spain is nothing more than a mantra cries crumbs 4 dandies who want to sweep for House without knowing well take the broom.Leaving aside my every day clearer Mania towards Spanish film (if e.g. that.) highlight not only the excellent planning of the scenes (many of them musical numbers), in addition to the argument, which is a simple (very simple) but at the same time excellent also, and that end that although overused and ubiquitous from the beginning no longer surprise.Finally, Spanish producers take example of France and launch to make films of this kind, the public and their pockets thank you.</body>
