	<body>With Álvaro Fernández Armero me pasa lo mismo which with Hot hot heat by squishy to be the movie to present (the game of truth, for example) something will be that I will end up doing grace, and that is because everything is a lie (the own gunsmith told me a year ago that the dvd Edition is fucking because her has a very foreign producer untraceable.)Against all odds I happened it very well with her last movie, leaving whistling for his characters and their dialogues / discussions. On this occasion Toledo-Gutiérrez chemistry not weakens in no time and is comedy in its purest form in the journey to the airport.The Poza little leaves and strain, is not the cinema days and Antonio de la Torre is immense.In this comedy about less is football (as in The Host the bug) and more is that of losing fear and such, especially in love.Seeing as it is the national scene today, you laugh at least awhile and you forget the photography, which is a little vulgar. But I liked (the movie).</body>
