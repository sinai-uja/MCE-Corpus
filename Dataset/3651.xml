	<body>We know that was the exploitation of low-budget film, if something gets fashion minimally we to clever director or producer of the moment pointing to this fashion to see if it sounds the flute.It is and not another is the purpose of the rookie couple MICHAEL BARTLETT and KEVIN GATES that after pseudocumentales of success with undead as REC, the next film of romero DIARI OF THE DEAD or as not the American Remake of ECN to carry by title QUARANTINE, the couple launches to the pool to continue the open road to see if they get a success in this way.Away from that proposal ever to work in box office or not, we have an absolute mediocrity in a film shot in any way with a script which is the same as always, its technical aspects are non-existent, the makeup is amateur in a film that seems shot in a week-end in a bad way.Some moments of terror well done that surprises at some point level but it fails to save a set bored where everything is already seen.The actors include JONNIE HURN seen in PENETRATION ANGST or ANIMALS and JAMES FISHER to feature on HOOLIGANS. All are very young performers to begin their careers, the truth is that as they fail to participate in best titles they do crude oil.</body>
