	<summary>An attempt of mixing several genres that has become a disaster no feet or head and that he is not sense even though you try to.</summary>
	<body>With the only reference being a film set in the Austro-Hungarian Empire and in full pre-war era I Sabbath viewing of the awakening of love, a work of the British John Irvin, who many remember for the Fourth Angel or silent when the trumpets.The film tells the story of a female boarding school, away from any population, in which girls are educated rigidly from small for the sole purpose of turning them in ballet dancers.Mixing a large number of parallel stories, playing the dismissal, without clarifying anything at any time and with a lack of narrative amazing resources, the awakening of love is one of those movies that are half way between homosexual claim drama, suspense, historical (pseudo) gender and a host of them, resulting in the end a disconcerting productsomewhat absurd that it does not close any of the stories that opens and ends clarify in any of its aspects.Narrated with a tone that at times is an extreme hardness, unnecessarily lengthens unpleasant scenes, while take away time that could make is to understand something of this nonsense, in that time, the characters or nothing at all, they are able to assemble.Perhaps the only thing salvageable and notable from burning, are interpretations of its protagonists, including Jacqueline Bisset, appearing as head of distribution without being in a disservice to his dilates career management; because the reality is that in a film so, deeper behind included one in the credits, better.Finally, say that the recreation of scenarios is not bad, although excessively grim. A pilonga chestnut bored to the painted.</body>
