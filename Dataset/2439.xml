	<summary>Another fun way of doing animation, either with peanuts or puppets.</summary>
	<body>I have always loved "South Park" and since that I learned that he was going to make this movie, I was looking forward to seeing that they had occurred to the two "crazy" by its managers, just as they did with this strange tape called "BASEketball".The film is very funny, highlighting how well done they are puppets, which sometimes can remember the "mythical" Thunderbirds, they do however possible that may seem cumbersome, unsuccessfully, (and that is always seen threads) and the little "cajqueria" appearing is tomato and little else.The plot parodies everything that we have been living, weapons of mass destruction, terrorism and many doses of humor and bad baba, that make you go the movie flying. In addition to the "cameos" also in puppets of Michael Moore, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins, Sean Penn, Helen Hunt.En final, another fun way to do animation, either with peanuts or puppets.</body>
