	<summary>It is sober, serious in the exhibition of the current situation of the Kurds, and not lost nor in unnecessary sub-plots. Impressive landscapes.</summary>
	<body>Interesting film of Bahman Ghobadi, who already won the Golden shell for best film in the Festival of San Sebastian in 2004 with its terrible and beautiful "turtles can fly".Here is a story on the border of Iraqi Kurdistan, shortly after the fall of Saddam Hussein.Es interesting from beginning to end, although the pace is extremely irregular, with a first time frankly good and pretty, followed by another, where the allegories and symbolism are imposed to the hitherto narration lines.Note that they can spare you 15 minutes or so, being able to have removed some repetitive scene (dreams or visions of the protagonist).But it is a movie, broadly, pleasant, endearing characters, grateful humor (particularly in charge of the invaluable driver of the bus), and not bored ever.It is sober, serious in the exhibition of the current situation of the Kurds, and not lost nor in unnecessary sub-plots.Impressive landscapes.</body>
