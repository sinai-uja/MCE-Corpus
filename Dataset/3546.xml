	<body>Another film emerged after a popular video action game which seems to take the baton of RESIDENT EVIL or LARA CROFT among many others.The direction is entrusted in the French XAVIER GENS that with his previous work with the terrifying FRONTIERES gave enough to talk.Relying on a cast popular with the bad 4 jungle "Timothy Olyphant" and always sober DUGRAY SCOTT "Mission impossible 2, Enigma" is one of action with all the constants of the genre. Persecution at frenetic pace, some well choreographed fights with the typical girl of heart in the seductive model OLGA KURYLENCO seen in PARIS JET AIME is occasion.Not all the juice is removed the character but the director knows give what he asks, dispatching an entertainment to spend the afternoon at the end and at Cape is what it is. Another thing is that they think the fans to the game.</body>
