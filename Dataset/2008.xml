	<summary>Given the precedents and expectations... fiasco.</summary>
	<body>I have no desire to roll me. If he had not raised such great expectations, was the most expensive in history and come preceded of 2 pretty good parties, we would say it is an entertaining movie that is worth seeing is.But with similar precedents, I dare say that this has been a fiasco. And I admit that I lack expertise to justify it. Because special effects and history is not lacking. However he has left me cold. Too bad (up to 4, including himself) that they become good and vice versa.I liked much music, and some scenes such as the creation of the man of sand. Others, like making cool or dancing Parker seemed ridiculous.Anyway, what is the time and nothing more.</body>
