	<body>It was definitely not expected for my small critical. Perhaps the argument and the talks were not especielamente understandable for a young man to intellect penalties 4 years old.The case is that it is a story that does not leave the usual adventure film from my time, carried the field of cartoons in 3D, made by computer. A succession of events too frantic so that children are able to follow the thread of the film, that in my view. We are that the film had a pace too fast.However a little more adult perspective, recognize that seeing this film, perhaps, a couple of years later, had a best score for my young critical. The twists of "Buscando a Nemo", slugs that fantasy the ambient sounds of many of the scenes, even its soundtrack was starring them, are situations rather than funny adults collect quickly, but children do not have the slightest effect.If outside little, were not the evil plans of the "Toad" who terrorized my young critic, but the fact that the poor girl, owner of the mouse, was run out of your pet. -To understand this part of the criticism it is necessary to see the movie and interpret from the mind of the critic who speaks through my lyrics-.So therefore on this occasion I puntuaré just with a regular, because, for him, is behind this film "Colleagues in the forest", "Ant Bully" and "The Corral". Anyway, personally I recommend it if the aim is to have a fun time with kids of not less than about 6 or 7 years, calculus I. Although the biggest laughter heard them from an adult who sat to my left.</body>
