	<summary>Stays in a brief sketch of the conflict in the Middle East where, unfortunately, and perhaps caused by a rather than abrupt mounting, everything is diluted like sugar in coffee</summary>
	<body>Benigni, is back after the hiper-premiada "life is beautiful" and the failure of its "Pinochio" in real image, tries with all his strength to certain doses of comedy, mixed with bitterness, but falls in the repetition and seems the script (in part) to his successful film, as well as the repetition of their "tics" and jokes of the other.Unfortunately Benigni, parking the freshness that had "life is beautiful" and with a very interesting topic as the conflict in the Middle East, stays in a brief note, where, unfortunately, and perhaps caused by a rather than abrupt mounting, everything is diluted like sugar in coffee.Great Jean Reno and Nicoletta Braschi, this latest film producer (you have to remember that it is the wife and Muse of director.) and a soundtrack; with a theme of Tom Waits of Fund, as in "life is beautiful" comes to tire in its repetition.In short, a film which will be remembered most as "life is 2 Bella" than by its original title.</body>
