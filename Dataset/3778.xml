	<summary>James Wan returns to remove stomachs and consciousness with his last film.</summary>
	<body>The last film by James Wan, director of "Saw" returns to comply with the principles of the Group given by Total Film magazine called "Slat Pack". If you've seen "Saw" you know I am referring to what trend: films extremely violent in to put to test the stomach of the viewer with explicit acts of aggression. Many of them have a marked character terrifying.Personally the violence does not attract me, but I left me seduced by the plot of the film: one father any of that crazy American society has bad luck with his son in the wrong, at the wrong time place and sees how his offspring dies at the hands of a few robbers. Fruit of chance is trapped in a vast Web of violence and the descent to the underworld make him deal with his own nature. Increasingly more animal, more and more like the murderers of his son, we are witnessing brutal "eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" between him and the violent group of assassins, until that can only be one.To narrate this fast-paced story Wan opts for the camera in hand in most of the shots. Ian Jeffers signed the script, based on the novel by Brian Garfield, making use of an overflowing imagination to make each murder more grotesque than the previous.Kevin Bacon has some memorable moments from the interpretative standpoint, as when bids farewell to his young son. However, when it becomes "Terminator" the viewer has to make a remarkable effort imaginative by believe in such circumstances and starring in such actions.Appeal to lovers of action, weapons and the images a bit gores. If you are one of those who you tides with blood, better absten you see.</body>
