	<body>I'm back to bite! I'm back to bite! A hilarious comedy, and a milestone of a kilo!. And that happens to me for failure to inform me before. It is that they are tucked into the garlic of Napoleon Dynamite nothing more and nothing less, one of the films of cult (which has nothing to do with culture) of those that I do not hear that it will. Well, nothing, ale, to me this monster, with the endorsement of the critics and the public.The film tells the story of Ignacio, which becomes Super Nacho to devote to wrestling. He is a man of faith and should not combat, but discovers that by doing this it can help a lot to the children of the orphanage where he resides (is a species of religious). Between cross you a hungry fighter with more bones than meat and a lustrous nun that causes you to lose the oremus.NA, that neither liked nor I like. It has nice moments, but little thing more. The script is quite linear, turns sharp, telling us a story with their introduction, his knot and its outcome. The actors are not bad, but the thing does not end to grace, perhaps there is to go to see her with another mentality.In short, comedy drama, without any moment of genuine delusion and quite childish situations (for a movie for adults).</body>
