	<summary>An original tape, although I understand that the book retains much more bad baba that the film...</summary>
	<body>Struck me the trailer, a new idea of as they should be "progress" of the films, and it is that it showed the initial minutes of the same, go, leaving us with honey on the lips, come on, if a want to know more. you already know. (go to the cinema to see).The tape, a tragicomedy, encloses the ins and outs of the world of fashion, slightly inspired by the magazine Elle (and there is not another in the sector that is so), and its Director, (great Meryl Streep on screen, literally eating on screen to all those who appear in the same.) Anne Hathaway in her line, and is that the side much (and her will continue to costing) remove the sanbenito "Disney" and continues to be the extroverted girl (some comparing it with the new Julia Roberts), met in the films "Princess by surprise".Perhaps, the best of the film are secondary, that Stanley Tucci, who acts as a fairy godmother/awareness of Hathaway, Emily Blunt (as a bad stepsister), Simon Baker (as principe azul), and is that, as read (my great friends of muchocine.net), it is easy to compare the film with a fairy tale that the presence of Hathaway, is not strange. Finally, tape original, although I understand that the book retains much more bad baba than the movie.</body>
