	<summary>The worst film of the 21st century, or perhaps this digital chronicler had a bad day and need a second pass...</summary>
	<body>There is no subliminal discourse. There are not even speech. Tourists engolfa his vocation blockbuster with a colorful string of clichés that prevent the free movement of blood in the brain of the spectator, which is at all times regarded as stupid. This chronicler was an unfortunate hour in which I basculé between the uncertainty about my true movie buff stamina and the certainty that the exposure would cause me irreparable harm. What do I know: perhaps onwards not can enjoy Fritz Lang or the good Swedish movies arthouse (God save the master Bergman). Maybe, not just to be sure, my sensitivity is has bitten at all and already can not, Oh, engolosinar me with my usual rations of good cinema. What is good cinema for this digital scribe do because anyone that excited me: anyone that seeks me AWE.?? To me this carioca outburst of mindless tourists (da like that are not excessively hormonados teenagers) found me one of the films more hollow of the history of the Cine.Esta night look go to Vincent Minnelli: captives of evil, 1952. Kirk Douglas and a ravishing femme fatale called Lana Turner. The I've seen enough times, but I know you still have the ability to make me happy. That film. Of tourists is not film: is visual masturbation. The curious reader warned is. I do not know the end, but I had no commitment to climax that maybe necessary to warn the moral force of the plot.</body>
