<review author="Oscar Cantero" title="Retrato de una obsesiÃ³n" rank="2" maxRank="5" source="muchocine">
	<summary>Once again mixes facts with fiction, running the risk of confusing the one with little knowledge of the events of what is true and what not.</summary>
	<body>Portrait of an obsession is a tribute to the famous American photographer Diane Arbus, in this dangerous and ambiguous genre that combines in a manner somewhat reckless historical facts contrasted with fantasies of a screenplay.In particular, it tells the eventful and controversial love story of a reporter's family wealthy with a satrap and anarchic arrogant neighbor who introduces in the lower depths and leads her to hobnob with all kinds of asocial and marginalized individuals. Nicole Kidman is an actress with a significant amount of records, what makes it feel comfortable in this type of roles, while Robert Downey Jr. shines with their own light on this occasion, giving good sample that recently takes good the time spent outside of jail or the courts. One of the great Remora which may have this film is the intention of the Distributor to try to present it as a pure thriller, drawing on tricks like change the poster or give it a Spanish name has no similarity with their original, Fur. On the technical side, the film is quite correct, with an appropriate use of the close-ups and silences. In any case, portrait of an obsession at times, slashing vulgarity in his argument, and lacks the thrust, the efugios and the absorption capacity of the viewer that should have to be considered a good movie. Anyway, the worth of the protagonist Duo may be sufficient reason for deciding to dedicate a little more than two hours covering their footage.</body>
