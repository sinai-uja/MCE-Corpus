	<body>Already he hold no more. After seeing a handful of times Spaced and Shaun of the dead I discovered that I could not wait until almost October to see Hot Fuzz, so even before the possible press pass (which must go if or especially if it is one of the dandies) I bought the American dvd conveniently subtitled into Spanish. And he started Hot Fuzz. Wright likes the fast as well as the classic, and what begins as a police comedy becomes a film of Agatha Christie without forgetting that they are few, very few, directors / writers which translate as effectively couple problems. If they have 15 years doing well not going to begin to get worse now. And follows the tone of pleasant comedy, with infinite influences all acquired genres and for having. until that becomes Cluedo. And the thing improved because, let us not forget, Edgar Wright &amp; Cia have created one of the most cojonudos Grindhouse trailers fake: Don't. It is clear that with Hot Fuzz had time to spare to prepare it and that means that there is blood in HF. No insulting quantities but which there is is spectacular. Metalengüaje of quality and maybe more like (ratites) with Kiss Kiss Bang Bang than with Shaun of the dead. In short, one of the best films of the year and probably the best comedy. The wait has been worth.</body>
