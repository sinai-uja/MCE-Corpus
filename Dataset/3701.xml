	<body>"I'm now going to make a movie better than Hitchcock" said Wilder and led his own courtroom drama to the big screen. Sir Wilfrid Robarts is an old ailing lawyer whose instinct of Fox forces him to take the case of Leonard Vole. An inventor of little rides charged with the murder of an elderly woman, solitary and rich, who frequented by friendship.Clearly, the charge seems unfair but the circumstances indicate it as the prime suspect. Everything is complicated when his wife, Marlene Dietrich evil, declared against him. In a few hours Robarts has to deal to save his client from the gallows. Although everything is concentrated on the future of this piece of Agatha Christie, Wilder garnished the film with brilliant dialogues where humor is mixed with the jargon of lawyers. Constructs a round character, Wilfrid Robarts, very insightful although next to his final heart attack, always pursued by his nurse who escapes to smoke their cigars.</body>
