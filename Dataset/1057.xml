	<summary>Finally, a new way to start the Bond saga, with better presence on screen. Again the man...</summary>
	<body>All those that are rasgaron vestments before the election of Daniel Craig as new Bond, now must go biting the tongue (and poisoning at the same time), a Bond was never so brutal as it is Craig, nobody has ever transmitted both in so little, as it has done it this, and never a film in the bond series has seemed so interestingwell shot and fun at the same time.This Bond recalls to the old, but not Timothy Dalton nor Pierce Brosna, bond's metrosexual, but an ironic bond, bastard and evil facing, that brings in check up to the very Q, a debtor of Sean Connery and Roger Moore bond; the tape also has a bad entity, as it is Le Chifre, one that, like darth Maul in Star Wars, with their very presence already produced dread.At this point, you notice that the movie I loved, from the opening credits, with great openness in black and white and the topic of Chris Cornell man that was behind grupillos such as Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, or now Audioslave.Tal time, 2 negative notes that I give the film are, which could happen by any other tape actionIf were it not for the endless 007 franchise, (where is the main theme?), and that the presence of Eva Green, much to be promoted as the best girl bond, sincerely seems to me or that their presence, nor its appeal is incompatible with the rest of ladies who populated the screen.Finally, a new way to start the Bond saga, with better presence on screen.</body>
