	<body>New twist to the Arthurian myth, from an idea inspired by the novel of Manfredi, tells us the wars between Romans and barbarians from a mythological perspective, without concern for historical accuracy, with which this will be a minimum factor when it comes to qualify a product has nothing new to contribute to gender and which aims to establish themselves with a certain commercial appeal imitating some of the films that most impact commercial have had in recent years.Specifically, with regard to the characterization of characters and the argument, baby trilogy the Lord of the rings by Peter Jackson or the phantom menace (or also from Pirates of the Caribbean), and thus see a Ben Kingsley who interprets a new Merlín-Gandalf-Quigong-jinn and the child actor Colin Firth - Frodo Baggins-Anakin Skywalker representing the chosen that will restore the Roman hegemony according to the prophecy of the day. I.e., a hodgepodge of magic, pseudohistory and philosophy cheap stuck with the sole purpose of entertain nothing demanding viewers. And the truth is that Doug Lefler achieves a film for a decent pastime without absurdities that are too ridiculous or excessive pretentious ornaments, a simple story told through a discreet and conventional visual style battles reminiscent of the style of Jackson in the two towers and the final strikes on the eternal theme of the need to believe in heroes and legends.It is obvious, however, that we are dealing with a film saturated with topics and plagiarism to its precedents, not you can say much more than what could be said about any movie made minimally, to view, enjoy awhile, and forget forever.</body>
