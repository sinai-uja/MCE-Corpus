	<body>I will say without shame that we have one of the best films of animation of the year, there are a couple of planes in the tape that are well worth the price of the entrance to the room to see them, the tape, the Burton style tells situations calculated almost to the millimeter and that nothing happens in the tape "because if" but that everything has a raison d ' être and finally (Ribbon only lasts an hour and a quarter) the result doesn't disappoint.Furthermore, although towards the middle of the tape the low film a bit of pace, the end result is excellent, the music of Danny Elfman (Burton collaborator) does not break at any time the narration, and although it is not a movie especially recommended for kids of the House, the older difrutarán it from beginning to end.Cuidadisima the aesthetics of one and the other side (the world of the living and the world of the dead.) the Victorian of the film is measured and studied ambiance, and the beginning of the film, perhaps with a couple of "bad baba" to Disney notes make it very hypnotic that leaving the film one not can stop thinking about the movie over and over again.</body>
