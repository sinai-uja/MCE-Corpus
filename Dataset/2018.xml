	<body>Read Spider-Man 3 comments clarify that it is slow, which is the weaker of the three, which lasts more than suitable. And they are right. Sam Raimi is perhaps Peter Jackson, managers who matured more cinematically speaking (or discuss their developments with the technique itself). From Caterpillar to Butterfly in a few years, bad taste the Lord of the rings, to these Spiderman for Raimi Darkman, in a remarkable breakthrough. Spider-Man 3 is not a step backwards but yes a faux pas, a film that is unnecessary if you want to. Half way in all their intentions. Mounting hyper accelerated the action scenes, that pale but were never the center of any of these Spider-man. From its middle part is as Raimi returns to auto parody scenes almost B class, and playing with his previous style with this silly humor and naif (dancing on the bar, the transformation of the black suit).Actors continue its role of taquito, the inclusion of the new villains only serve to some incredible moments in effects (fantastic scene of the creation of the man of sand) and very little else.Phrases related with the human goodness, too much dialogue towards nowhere that they lengthen and take away pace, memories of the murder of Uncle Ben, repeated infinitely, a script that deletes all the past events with the elbow (the 4 will do the same with this?), anyway, only understandable its realization by all the machinery of money which promotes and collects.The second Spiderman film was a challenge not only for Raimi, if not for all who wants to do a superhero movie. Here he could not keep their own steps. The only thing positive is that with infinite immediate projects, the comic in the film remains more alive than ever.</body>
