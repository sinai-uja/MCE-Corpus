	<summary>The history feature has no interest too. In fact almost nothing happens throughout the film, and if it was not Mr crossbow, this would be an infumable truño.</summary>
	<body>Today I read a magazine these youth came out in front the Juan José Ballesta this, and made him a very funny interview. Among the pearls that came to say, one was "I signed autographs up in tits", although it has made me more funny one that said "Assume Me his cock watching my movies". I guess that this not be her there will be tronchado.The movie is Samuel who is 18 years old and a very rare brain disease, epilepsy type. Parents you have always had overprotected, rightly, but upon reaching the age of majority decides to go with her cousin to the beach. Total, that whatever appears in the capital living alone and adapting to life without parents. And the thing goes on between voice-overs rather caused.Look, the movie not be or criticize. In fact almost nothing happens throughout the film, and if it was not Mr crossbow, this would be an infumable truño. But as leaving him because the thing has its pass. History that have is not too interested, it's just the life of a kid that has the problem that in the head, but otherwise they are always of housing, work and sex or love problems. The theme of voice-overs, as I have already said, usually I like a lot, seems to me very abusive and stole the little pace he could have the film. On the positive side, the role of the grandfather that appears, I also note that found me a very good job. But nothing, the movie is funny but little else.In short, a typical Spanish film movie that adds much and would not leave see too well. Few things saved it from burning.</body>
