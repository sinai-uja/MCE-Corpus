	<body>A play called EQUUS by PETER SHAFFER writer caused havoc in the 1970s, a good scandal thanks to a history full of madness where topics as tricky as the passion, religious fervor, not exempt from violence sexual misunderstanding was the ultimate expression.Surprising is that a director who at the time enjoyed the compliment of all global criticism with successes of the caliber of SERPICO, A ruthless world or afternoon of dogs involved in a very risky project.A HOLLYWOOD legend added to the project in the face of RICHARD BURTON's great protagonist of the celluloid masterpieces. The night of the iguana, the robe or Cleopatra gave him immortality accompanied by a young and unknown actor PETER FIRTH was not too fortunate career despite the talents deployed in TESS or JOSEPH ANDREWS finishing on television and in very supporting roles.On the translation to the screen we see a faltering start with a mise en scene similar to the movie, a not entirely fluent narrative that can lead to thinking in the viewer that is perhaps a failed attempt to engage the original spirit of the text. Suddenly everything starts to change, the tone rises quickly, the two main performers are beaten in a memorable duel, the story takes an unusual force at each level reaching a final part that leaves you totally noqueado.EQUUS is a confrontation of two beings adrift, a life that in the eyes of the rest is ordered but the psychiatrist suffers a routine that devours it inside in a world that did not dare to challenge, discovers the passion in his patient patient who despite his madness to managed to claim a life force that took him to distress for parents on protectors and a mother enveneno you I the mind of religious facts which the young confused in his relationship with horses.A cheap film without paraphernalia faces two different worlds but at the same time they collide in a freedom that the two characters yearn unsuccessfully.Sadomasochism, sex, dementia, religious Fervor and if they press me something zoophilia disguised in a work shot with the bowels of some interpreters and delivered in one of the crazy director more beautiful and inspiring that reflects multiple readings.Certainly a risk that the current film is not allowed and why these works are today almost unique in a world that gives back to the true art in favour of easily digestible mediocrity for the $.</body>
