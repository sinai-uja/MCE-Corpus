	<body>For a long time not he enjoyed both the presence of Judi Dench on screen, now, and the cast with a no less excellent Cate Blanchett, Bill Nighy, without any makeup (I becomes rare after seeing "carapulpeado" in the saga of "Pirates"), in this film, almost theatrical, that could well happen by one of these telefilms which broadcast on any television channel in desktop.Both actresses carry the weight of the film, accompanied in the baton of Phillip Grass with a score that marks a dramatic pattern at all times, especially liked the voice of Dench narrating the events, so as that Blanchett has a child with Down syndrome, for server, the most precious children of the planet.They say that an actress makes her good work when it manages to transfer his interpretation on the screen, Dench succeeds at all times, giving life to this disgusting Hag, bitter, deranged and desquiciante, at all times.During the projection I thought a story I read since some years ago, of a similar event to which recounts the tape what happened in the USA, I desvelaré no more, not enter in the area of the plot to be discovered, to not break the magic of the film.Curiously the poster reminds the Almodovar film "Talk to her", I leave only a moral, and it is that paper also speaks, sadly, but speaks.</body>
