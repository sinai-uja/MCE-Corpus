	<summary>It does not have the magic of the lovers of the Arctic circle. I'll take some pictures of beautiful, as always in Medem, Said, the man, and with the relationship man/women posed by this film: man = war; Women = life; Man = rapist; Women = bitch.</summary>
	<body>Or what is the same, Medem vs Guerin. Recently I have seen "Caótica Ana" and "En la ciudad de Sylvia" and I love to talk about them. I will give you my impression. Those who know me know that I am a big fan of Medem, so the expectation that had to see his last film was huge, as was my disappointment. "Chaotic Ana" has Medem stuff but not the magic of "The lovers of the Polar circle" in any frame. Expresiveness actress, is a current girl who says that it is beginning to study acting, and you have a long way ahead, to start: must learn. History, has nice things, I do not deny it, but he speaks of something that I never comes at all. A girl who after hypnosis comes to contact with their previous lives, all young women with great tales and tragic deaths. Reincarnation would be long topic of discussion, but in principle, I do not know if the education of my biologist mother or my studies of philosophy, I do not believe in this. I'll take some pictures of beautiful, as always in Medem. I prefer Said, man. I'll take the relationship man/women posed by this film: man = war; Women = life; Man = rapist; Women = bitch.</body>
