	<summary>With Chihiro comparisons are odious</summary>
	<body>The film is a teenage girl who works sombrerera. A good day to go out on the streets, her assails a bolting and mysterious boy, who is pursued by some amorphous creatures of black and hat. After flying fleeing the pursuers, she returns to his tent, where awaiting a kind of fat lady. This, after angry with the kid, spear a spell which turns into old woman, forcing her to look for Howl so that can remove you the enchantment. So explained it appears to be very rare, but it is not so much.Well, it's always very curradas animations and nice stories. What I liked most is that the girl, turn to old woman, leads him with all naturalness, saving us the expected interval in which strives to become young again. The characters are quite curious, having a devil of the fire that hides a secret, a scarecrow with turnip head, a child who is the only normal, fat witch, which is then dehydrated and seems Jabba the Hut (on the war of the galaxies), the own Howl that the infighting that brings is not very well known and the teenager - old which has its thing. The story returns to the style of Laputa Castle or spirited away, not coming to be as good as the last but better than the of Laputa.Resumiendo, which if you are tremendous fans of the saga, you will like much, but expect to take her by fascicles and the compreis with a film manga than ever you will see. I personally, from my point of view of fan, recommend her strongly. To the kid may like it, although you can give something of fear.</body>
