	<summary>It comedy more than disposable, of those that husbands consort we endure in the film, and women are happy to contemplate what happens on screen.</summary>
	<body>Tells the story of a couple newly married Carl and Molly Peterson (Dillon and Hudson), that decide to accommodate the best friend of this, Randy Dupree (Wilson), the godfather of the wedding, who has just lost his job and his house in his new home. Stay for a few days, however, soon becomes permanent because neither of them knows how to tell is enough.Do some years ago (and sorry that I put into plan grandfather green onion), G men sang that of "Can't stand your cousin", because they get that song, estirenla nauseam, placed instead of the heavy premium of David Summers, Owen Wilson with his face of bobo and already have the simple film shot with 3? and pretending (as have) razing on-screen, there they have one comedy and throw-away, of those that husbands consort we endure in the film, and women are happy to watch what happens on screen, and try to transmute it to his real life.How much are going to laugh my friends from muchocine when they know that in this, again, I had to pass by the box office box.</body>
