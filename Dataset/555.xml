	<body>Sometimes David r. Ellis has directed films that have at least been entertaining, as they were the cases of Cellular and Final destination 2. This time he has been behind the camera for shooting snakes on the plane, a film whose only attraction lies in the presence of the Samuel l. Jackson always correct, and if I tightened the curiosity to see Elsa Pataky tried to prove that it is also an actress as well as beautiful. And I say this because we are before one of the films most absurd and ridiculous that they can imagine. The argument is surreal (giving surreal an extremely pejorative nuance), that narrates the adventures of a policeman who guards the witness of a murder during a flight. To avoid his statement, the criminal fills the plane of snakes to ensure that does not arrive alive at their destination. With this crazy approach dealt more than 100 minutes this nonsense does lose to that see. Full of vulgar jokes, incoherent dialogues and abrupt changes of plane, snakes on a plane is a film so grotesque and ridiculous causing curiously just the opposite of what he intended. And it is what gives is more than terror, laughter see vast quantities of snakes moving through the interior of an aircraft causing the hysteria of the passage; how hilarious is the improbability of the story. Full of clichés and a public-oriented teen, it fits in the genre known as Serie B, and while it may arouse some curiosity at the beginning, his interest is diluted as it progresses the footage, to the point that one has just asking for time. But of course, as they say, the book of tastes is blank.</body>
