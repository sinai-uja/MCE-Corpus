	<summary>As a film, is very bad, now, that I could laugh, it jumped me tears</summary>
	<body>Damn, only to see the poster already I mondo of laughter. And it is that these films have something that I love, and is that you can't sleep you a little while, and when you open the eye, still learning that it is. In a way, it is very similar to a porn movie. And like these, it is difficult to see a complete without becoming bored sovereignty. But this, to me, was an exception and I saw entire willingly.The film has neither argument nor established screenplay, since that is a sequence of funny situations that parodían "serious" films. So, tell you that the movie is about uniting "Saw", "The war of the worlds", "Million Dollar Baby", "Brokeback Mountain", "The forest", "The curse" and the embarrassment of George Bush when the 11-S in the movie parodies without end. Not be if I had missed some parodied film, but with this we have an idea, right? Well, we can see in the scene in which the President of the United States of America some of "Independence Day" above all to see a President of that country to think of a solution, ja, ja, ja.Wow, the film as a film, is very bad. Now, what I could laugh, that jumped me the tears. The argument does not exist, although not spin too bad scenes. The players are very good, highlighting the nonsense to Shaquil O´Neal under the skin of one saw or the poor girl in the war of the worlds. And it is that in these films should not speak of lighting, soundtrack, photography, etc. It is only measured in patochadas and goofiness, and this has surpassed outweigh those than I expected. And to make matters worse, only lasts 75 minutes, so if you don't like, in a moment ends your ordeal.In short, that the movie I really liked, with great moments such as the boxing match.</body>
