	<summary>The film? Truly anyone interested my opinion of such patochada?</summary>
	<body>Yet another romantic comedy I have to see / hold and is that, for a time this part, my wife (fan of this type of film) has given to an endless list all these films, that: 1) seem to cut by the same pattern. 2) do not provide anything and aburren.3) not interested, not fun, not entusiasman.4) every month there are 4 or 5 of these on-screen.Not long ago, I read one of my critical favorites in press, rant based on good of this film, I'll stick with the end of criticism, know, suffered spectators, watching these movies from the only public deceased deserves a desbaratadora sex session of the malaise afflicting us, so we will have to continue watching them, and sufríendolas (no doubt), but always for the "good dust" later. the film? Truly anyone interested my opinion of such patochada?</body>
