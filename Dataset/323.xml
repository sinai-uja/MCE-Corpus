	<body>Silent Hill is based on a video game that I'll never play, he has painted for am and I am not for these scares.The film is a couple with an adopted daughter of about eleven years. This is night and usually try to kill during their nocturnal raids, shouting that it is in Silent Hill. Total, the mother still with the opposition of the father, goes to Silent Hill, which is an abandoned village of the United States, who suffered a string of horrific fires to make its unbreathable atmosphere. But nothing more to get there, and when they are pursued by a police motorcycle, suffer an accident. When he wakes up in the car, his daughter is not and the police tries to stop. A strange fog fly them over with a continuous ash cloud. It is in Silent Hill.Oye, that most interesting film. I was expecting something many special effects without ton or they are mutant assassins and heroines starting with love of House with the curls. But no, or much less. This film has a solid plot, with an atmosphere very worked, suffocating at all times. I was delighted that there are two parallel investigations, one of them that takes place between two parallel worlds. The only issue is that to learn well to walk very closely. Each frame, the thing it is entangled, resolving at the end, but if you have not yet followed you have left a little stupid face. And the end me has seemed very serious and very well closed, without patochadas or nonsense.In short, film of intrigue on fantastic scenarios, with much storyline and some that another fright to release tension. To see with your senses alert, not to lose between name, dates and figures.</body>
