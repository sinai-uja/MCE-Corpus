	<body>Have you ever seen a live magic show? I can assure you that it changes a lot to when seen on television, in fact, it has nothing to do. When what you see with your own eyes you feel again like a child: excited with the fantasy to believe in magic. And that is what gets the protagonist of our story reaching unsuspected extremes. Based on the eponymous story of the American Steven Millhauser (Pulitzer Prize in 1997 for the work Martin Dressler), the illusionist is situated at the end of the 19th century Vienna, place where politics, love and magic will play a very important role.Edward Norton (that boy's sad face) the role of Eisenheim fits like a glove, but it should not forget interesting work of Rufus Sewell as Prince Leopold.La film conveys an aura of romanticism inherent to the own theme, which is also reflected in the perfect atmosphere aided largely by a few exquisite decorated, not to mention an elaborate costume work during all times. The mounting is very dynamic and adjusted so it will not have the feeling that we need to or too much information (some very welcome in these times). With regard to the necessary use of special effects for some scenes, not having abused them has allowed stabilize two universes without the viewer sits expelled from the argument.In summary, a good story, well told and entertaining: worth seeing her.</body>
