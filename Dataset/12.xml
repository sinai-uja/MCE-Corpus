	<summary>A calque of nightmare before Christmas.</summary>
	<body>I thought he was going to see something new Tim Burton, but I found a film that is entertaining, but that resembles its predecessor nightmare before Christmas. Anyway film as indicated above this well, has this Gothic atmosphere so characteristic of Burton, note the game of lights and some frames that make it look like a flesh and blood actors film, the story is original and has quite a few touches of humor, but what I don't like and it happens also with Disney films is they sing, for this type of formula and the characterization of the characters keep saying and I conclude here, La Novia cadaver seems part of nightmare before Christmas.</body>
