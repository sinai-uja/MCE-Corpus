	<summary>All very typical saves thanks to the brutality of the deaths and the charm given off despite the mediocrity.</summary>
	<body>With American production Valencian Juan Piquer Simón: "SUPERSONICMAN", "The cleft" done as is usual a bad film with interpretations of laughter a script already thousand times seen in thousands of previous slashers, some with the same producers as for example the day of the innocents. Series b of the era actors walk giving the film an international imprint with Christopher GEORGE "The terminator" or EDMUND PURDOM "Director and actor do not open until Christmas". All very typical saves thanks to the brutality of the deaths and the charm given off despite the mediocrity.</body>
