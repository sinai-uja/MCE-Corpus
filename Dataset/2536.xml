	<summary>More than simplistic romantic comedieta.</summary>
	<body>Since I saw "I want to be like Beckham" and "Monsoon wedding" caught much attention the film "indi" or Bollywood, as it is also often called, both this film and "Want to be like Beckham" are not produciones 100% Bollywood, as in the film "indi" what more shining are few budgets and that the actors are completely unknown.Something that attracts attention, the first time you see a film of these features is the color of the clothes (from the Orange, green, passing through colors that would lead anyone around here) to music, it is that the Indis put dance and count as if such a thing, and is the musical genre there seems the more widespread among the Bollywoodienses.En this film should be noted the presence of the gorgeous Miss World 1994 Aishwarya Rai. his name is pronounced as noses?Martin Henderson, who remember as the father of the little protagonist of "The ring" and Naveen Andrews, that many of you do not you know, but those who continue the series "Lost" know him as "Sayid" Arabic of the group.Finally, a curious movie with an amazing soundtrack (is that Pyrrha me indi music), that as in the poster will make dance in the armchair! Eye, that is a simplistic romantic comedy.</body>
