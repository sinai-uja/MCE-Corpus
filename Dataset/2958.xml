	<body>So damaged a license cojonuda to shooting a brick brick Man-Starring: Nicolas Cage.Porque 'Ghost Rider' is a real brick of considerable dimensions. And it is that when only conjugation of a film are its special effects, tits and ass of an actress and one (only one) of his characters, something goes really wrong.The script seems has written it a niñato pajillero of thirteen: the argument has no feet or head, is so tontorrón and predictable that only to see the poster already you can imagine throughout the film. The characters and, above all, LOS VILLANOS (if they can be called thus because they seem to be taken from 'Mystery Men'), are authentic jokes talking and walking; the actors do not help because they all seem to be there reluctantly, trying to put any face to convince that the character trying to interpret are taking seriously.And those crappy flashes salchicheros when do appearance the bad very bad, pffff.Because, it is even boring. And the absolute prota also is Nicolas Cage, guarantee of sudden attacks of embarrassment, at least on my part.As I said before, the only thing salvageable from this mediocridad-más - mediocre-to-'DareDevil' are its special effects, Eva Mendes cuerrrrrrrpazo, and the same Ghost Rider, that is the lironda Peel, but leaves little, becoming so sad one of the characters and clumsily unused long in the history of the film adaptations of the comic.And those yet to come.</body>
