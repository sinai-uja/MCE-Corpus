	<body>The world of the DVD is a SAC bottomless for films of those that you doubt that really have recorded or that they are simply pieces of others stuck with greater or less master. The work today is without place to doubt, of these. By the way, the cover of the DVD promises promises unless it puts it. This seems more than what it is then, that I will head to other paths.The film is about an imaginary Empire which worships the Bull. As the village is becoming unbeliever, rather than creating the football to dominate the beasts, they do their God Bull copule with his Queen as well getting a semi God tangible for the Plebs. A Minotaur with very bad milk that feeds on blood and other viscera out them of these. So what they enclose in a maze and you are throwing Virgin both insofar as that the boy go desfogando. A young man decides to save his girlfriend and offers to be sacrificed.My mother, pelicul√≥n video club meat (I think it was released directly on DVD) that we have swallowed as well as stupid. The beginning is very promising, with a very interesting history and a woman in porretas. But as it is advancing the thing loses bellows, disappears the action and we can only a deformed Minotaur that gives particularly to anyone who catches. The end is very absurd, but it leaves the movie a nice aftertaste.In short, film with few pretensions (I guess) of a Minotaur fed mancebas and virginal mancebos, musculitos and tattooed beauty. For a silly day of those who do not know if cut you the veins or left you them long.With this morlaco I would like to see more than one Bullfighter.kisses.</body>
