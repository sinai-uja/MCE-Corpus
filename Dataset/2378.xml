	<summary>Anxiety, claustrophobia, tenderness and talent assembled under the outstanding leadership of John Houston. Something like the Philharmonic of Vienna directed by Karajan.</summary>
	<body>Those who today classified psychological horror any film which occur in two silences, they should take a look at many productions over the years 40 and 50 that, like this, show how to maintain tension and provoke a sense of anguish only playing with the silences, the close-ups and body language.Cayo Largo, directed by John Houston, tells the story of a veteran of the second world war, that comes in a small hotel of Los Cayos, in Florida, to see the father and the widow of a fellow of trenches. Unexpectedly, he meets a gang of mobsters who stay at the establishment, and there begins the real film.Humphrey Bogart, little can be said to not know, although in my view, the interpretive weight and the brightest of the proceedings, is that rests with Edward g. Robinson, one of those actors who by whims of fate, does not enjoy the recognition and fame deserved by his enormous talent. Lauren Bacall, we will not discover anything, while Claire Trevor received even an Oscar for her performance.As I said before, this film causes a wide range of sensations, that pass through the tenderness, intrigue, claustrophobia, anxiety and concern; This is due to a great script and exemplary leadership.On the negative side of the scale, it could be a somewhat hasty conclusion and certain ups and downs in the pace of development; but without greater significance or importance. Without doubt, a classic film, to which only the fact of being contemporary of epic titles have been deprived of occupy a high place in the Olympus of the film.</body>
