	<summary>An authentic jewel that would hardly be distributed outside festivals specialized losing into oblivion, one of the proposals more a counterflow of current cinema that breaks all the molds.</summary>
	<body>When I learned of this project could not believe me that someone was prepared to carry out such history.The unknown director ROBINSON DEVOR earned his candidacy for unconscious or perhaps crazy year. Surely with the scandal that would mark it out of anonymity, no doubt because proved to be an author of quality in his previous film, "POLICE BEAT" a hard urban drama about a single disputed neighborhood seen in festivals.With average amateur actors, only seen in very small nature productions. Stresses the great work of JHON PAULSEN "VISIONEERS" and RICHARD CARMEN "BLOODY MARY" serving well in the fictional part because the other part of the film is a documentary with interviews on such events. That is a fact of life.I think that is clearly understood the difficulties of dealing with similar plot, could stay just as the typical morbid film or try something really offensive for the Viewer.Nothing of that, we have high quality work, seeking the easy curiosity, at no time developing for a few poetic paths of great sadness. A melancholy visible thanks to his enormous picture, soundtrack and interpretations to the surface. At times it evokes the TERRENCE MALICK film in this strange beauty that shines every level as it were a table. I believe that none of the human is alien to me, and hombres-animales sex happens really. Then, it is also part of what we are. With such statements of the director is clearly what the film wants to count and sincerely makes it wonderfully. An authentic jewel that would hardly be distributed outside festivals specialized losing proposals more into oblivion one a counterflow of current cinema that breaks all the molds.</body>
