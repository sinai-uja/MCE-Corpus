	<summary>A tape of vampires well constructed (based on a comic), well narrated, and situations fairly well planned, and although they are now seen in the genre in quite a few movies leaves a good taste.</summary>
	<body>I must admit that although I enjoyed with the film I felt quite disappointed, and it is, I don't know where it appeared that this tape would be made with the same effects and patterns that the excellent "300" and I have to say that perhaps the only resemblance with both is that they are based on a graphic novel, because this has more parallels with "Zombie" "dawn of the dead" or even 'the village of the damned'.In the cast have the deadpan Josh Harnett, that although you love my wife to my it seems that it has the same expressiveness than a chard, and is that it puts the same face when he killed, when someone you know dies, or when anything happens, we have companion to Melissa George, tanned in this kind of films, since not only appears here, but has been in "The abode of fear" supernatural terrors, or plots of "Tourists" organ transplants.Moreover, a tape of vampires well constructed (based on a comic), well narrated, and situations pretty well planned, and although they are now seen in the genre in quite a few movies is a good flavor of mouth, and for a time no smell sequel, that these tapes of terror, as it is known.</body>
