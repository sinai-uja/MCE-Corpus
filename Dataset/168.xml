	<body>All know those movies where you are slowly telling the story. Details at first unconnected, you know that they ended up having sense at the end. Many times, rather than the mystery of history, or where goes the screenwriter, who appreciate is that the explanation. elegant, that it does not appear in a forced way, and that you enjoy. Requirement essential, is not drive you crazy trying to anticipate what the history. Obviously you can not disconnect your brain, and ideas are happening, but you must participate in the game of the director, and let you take. If you do so, you can enjoy much of the film.In this case, if you meet the above, in case Slevin also you find a script full of good dialogue, funny and often interesting. The plot is relatively simple, and the director is shooting very effectively, with some images where stands that look as though that it was the camera and lighting (and if it was well a few times) while not continuing the story.On actions, well, I love Bruce Willis, and here he is completely, so I love. Secondary, or Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley, and no more, all of them very, very well. Finally, the main character, Josh Harnett, begins as a version of his character in 40 days, 40 nights, and so already can follow you perfectly, it is simply a little pardillo. Special mention, for Lucy Liu, than this prettier than ever, truly beautiful, and its role is fun, active and you want to return to the screen.In short, funny, entertaining, at times intriguing, with a great Bruce Willis and a lovely Lucy Liu. It is worth going a week night to see her.</body>
