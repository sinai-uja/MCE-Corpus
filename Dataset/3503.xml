	<body>Some years ago, my sister, watching as I aficionaba to junk food, recommended me a book written by a physician of the Army USA (if memory does not fail me, and if it fails I forgive me) spoke about the evil fast food in the States and by fault of hygiene and bad food education, had hundreds of deaths around the world; I would say the book struck me, and that it took me long time to not only look at a hamburger with eyes of desire, but it cost me swallow it calmly to overcome my first care.Richard Linklater, is one of those directors who, as does a drama or a comedy, a tape of abysmal depths here directs a tape well constructed, brief, intense and full of aromas, sometimes to Ketchup, others to mustard, and many others to blood and human suffering.Since the "Crash" to triumph, and long before other tapes of your invoice, we are putting in "fashion" of the films that tell various stories, just relacionandose each other, watching the same story or theme from different points of view; This time is no exception, and the tape of Linklater, shows both the profile of the Executive of the chain of ice, as employees, farmers and retailers. It is true that in some feeds more than in others. The cast we find a series of faces, many of them well-known, well known, cameos of common of the Linklater, and film actors that we have ever seen on screen (the latter for Mexican immigrants).In short: A tape that reaches the eyes, rises to the brain so we think, and it will never come to the stomach, strange, given that the tape is about food, advisable, although sometimes not give both whether, as it was to be expected.</body>
