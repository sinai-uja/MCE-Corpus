	<body>The shadow of nobody is a film of suspense and terror to the old-fashioned. It is not based its upheavals in the viscera or noises, but the recreation of situations that create atmospheres of tension which van in crescendo until that happens what has to happen. or not. This second work of Pablo Malo delves into the dark and gloomy environments we see in cold winter sun, and sharpens them much more, something that makes the supernatural theme of the plot. Framed within a rural, typical of the Pyrenees from the end of the 1960s people, the result is a film that keeps the interest of the Viewer from the beginning until the end, and allowing is you enjoy him for several aspects, such as that of a well-crafted script, complex personal relationships, some wonderful and of course landscapesa central thread worked and concise, although by no means simple.Grosso modo, the story is told the adventures of a teacher coming into a retired village to take a sabbatical because of an important labour mishap. In the municipality there is a female boarding school in which a girl has died recently, but apparently still loitering there. Interactions between the characters are immediate and intense, and although you run the risk of being repetitive, I must influence the ability to transmit sensations without dialogues with this film.On the downside, the excessive darkness of many levels and a not entirely round ending. In any case, the virtues that defects are larger and more numerous.</body>
