	<body>Interesting film of Paul Haggis, that after the successful and award-winning "Crash" was expected as rain in May.In my opinion not enough in quality to that, but is that not what intended, that it's a history intimate even though it escore squarely in the film of intrigue, more or less police.Most importantly, reflect what a war can do in the minds of young soldiers that fight in it, actually being rather large children.Tommy Lee Jones is splendid and gives a recital of dramatic intensity, often being not necessary nor to talk, because with the look says it all. He accompanies him, well, Charlize Theron, excellent.Good dialogues, mixture of spectacular with intimacy and a wise leadership which focuses on the clear narrative, without any delicacies, simply because no argument (based on real events) does not require. Good film, quite sober and entertaining.</body>
