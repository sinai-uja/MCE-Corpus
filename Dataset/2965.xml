	<body>Interesting thriller directed by the brother of the director of 'gladiator', where an interesting cast headed by November Denzel Washington is up to. but not without much stress.A kind of 'Minority Report' but smaller and vice versa. Entertaining from beginning to end, 'Déjà Vu' leaves in suspense the viewer during your footage, and knows very well to maintain the pace and intrigue.However disappointed in some other plot point: let loose and small unknowns unresolved in the air, something which reflecting on the final outcome of the tape hurts enough to put note.Despite this, entertaining.</body>
