	<body>My article today it is the turn to one of horror film produced by Quentin Tarantino and directed by Eli Roth, his title is Hostel 2. Well Hostel 2 is a film that impresses, and much, there are substantial scenes very stunning and impressive. It has an argument that goes on the same line of the first "Hostel" film, but quite unpredictable, or at least to my I was surprised on several occasions, and I believe that the argument you surprise to you also, personally prefer the argument of "Hostel 2" to the first part. In general it is best Hostel 2 film than Hostel. To give you an idea of how is this film I recommend that you see the poster were made for this occasion? are they worth seeing?The film begins with the murder of the only survivor of the Group of guys that went to Slovakia in the first film and the delivery to the leader of the club of hunting of the head of the boy from that point we could say that the relationship that may exist with the first film disappears. In this new installment, there are three girls who attend Slovakia deceived by another girl encountered while they were on a train. Does this time just as in the first film only one survives, that if not tell you or who survives, or how to survive, not because survives? all these data must discover them for yourselves watching this piece of film.The conclusion reached after see it, is that it is a film very good and quite strong, not suitable for cardiac? If you like strong emotions, I recommend that you go to see her. I also would encourage those who have not seen "Hostel" to that see, if you like the horror films Saw type, you are probably like you, and as a moral not go to Slovakia just in case?</body>
