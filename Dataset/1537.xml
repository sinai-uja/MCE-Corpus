	<body>Steve Oedekerk (famous for films of Jim Carrey) and member of Nickelodeon (where already premiered "Jimmy Neutron", it brings this tape of animation where the cows appear to these friendly stuffed animals anti-Stress.Con a predictable argument, seen on numerous occasions (from "the Lion King" to "Bambi"), and that captures the transition from youth to adulthood).On the other hand, dubbing this care and can listen to cows with Galician accent, mice with Mexican voice, even chicks with whistle voice.All this what do they do the bulls without horns and tits? It is not that I am very place in animals, but come on, I have not seen tits to a bull in life, this is very male and the horns? Finally noted the resemblance of "Mad Mike" with "Captain Caveman" (and son) and the time of the rat singing Shagyy Bombastick, a theme that is famous for being the song that accompanies a spot of Levi's.</body>
