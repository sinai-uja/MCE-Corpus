	<summary>The Farrelly brothers have entered into a spin, producing year after year a film more cumbersome, less elaborate, and where, despite some excellent first minutes, the thing starts to deflate more and more, until you reach the unexpected.</summary>
	<body>When I went to see, "Love in game" I realized that the Farrelly brothers had dropped the ready, and that after "Two very stupid fools" and the mega-hit "something happens with Mary" as well as the sympathetic "Love blind" cutrez they had entered into a spin, producing year after year a film more cumbersome, less elaborate, and where, despite some excellent first minutesthe thing starts to deflate more and more, until you reach the unexpected.Is true that Ben Stiller owes much to the Farrelly, thanks to them and to the film that starred with them alongside Cameron Diaz is today one of the stars of the comedy of our days, but both to make fools of ourselves over and over again? (and see that in "Something happens with Mary" it makes baskets). Add Malin Akerman, the incredible father of Stiller, Jerry, apart from Michelle Monaghan, and the final cameo of Eva Longoria, all together, but not scrambled in a tape, which of course I did not like anything, but that nothing, nothing.And where few things are saved from burning, and it is that, the absurd humor of the farrelly makes this time one finished the mosqueado projection, and not wanting to see his next comedy.Go week of bad movies I've been!And van.!PS: Did not know so many sexual positions, I will have to ask the RRMM "Kamasutra" and study it carefully.</body>
