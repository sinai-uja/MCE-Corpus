	<body>"A star of the rodeo in decadence try to rebuild their lives by joining a young marriage." "This somewhat destabilize the relationship of the couple".Extraordinary film of Nicholas Ray, without doubt, one of his best works (another masterpiece is undoubtedly "Johnny Guitar"). Although, in principle, it is clear that the story is not new, and therefore, original, yes that makes suggestive way to tell Ray it. Rarely has narrated so clear and clear the myth of the return to the home of a person, their attempts to find a few roots and influence of a supposed hero in another normal person but without excessive character. The performances are excellent, with an unusually poignant Arthur Kennedy. A film difficult to forget for his humanity, with a few dialogues are superb and admirable leadership.</body>
