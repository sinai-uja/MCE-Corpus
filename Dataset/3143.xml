	<summary>A terrifying story, based on real facts, makes me to reconcile me with the national dramatic film and at the same time with the arrival of Argentina.</summary>
	<body>When the movie premiered I liked that that while they shot the kid protagonist happened it really wrong in filming, and that gave him much fear history, and spent much of the same dead from fear, that I gave foot to interest me, not in morbid, but because if the small protagonist spent fear is that both had "quality" in the shooting, as in the story.That, before we talk about anything should be traced back to the Argentina of the last century, where a boy of 10 years known as "El Petiso Orejuno" he had, not only in check to the Argentine police, but also to all parents in the city, which could not rest assured knowing the vicious beast that walked through the streets.We have in this Argentinian co-production, Maribel Verdú (back to a papelón after "El Laberinto del Fauno") and Chete Lera (which always remember as a doctor of "Open the eyes" of Amenabar), as well as an excellent roster of Argentine actors, among which noteworthy newcomer Juan Ciancio, who was the child that was badly spent in filming.Both costumes, such as photography, and lighting (forgiving a small mistake at the beginning most of the film), the rest of this very accomplished, aside from the excellent recreation of Buenos Aires from the beginning of the last century (1912).Ultimately, a terrifying story, based on real events, which makes me to reconcile with the national dramatic film and at the same time with the arrival of Argentina.</body>
