	<body>The truth is that the idea was slightly interesting. If we saw night creatures terrorize Riddick by end up landing on the planet wrong, i.e., in one of those when the turn is remaining in the dark at all and leave the bugs antropófagos to eat, was only a matter of time before someone gave our Nordic countries also can be great for these situations of invasions of various monsters, in this case chupópteros of the worst kind, of those that when you bite or you pull half neck or you become one of them with a few teeth calling loudly to go to the dentist.The hurt is that such educational film (I at least learned to cut the head to someone is necessary to give three battering in the neck) to stay in an irrepressible succession of absurd topics. Don't know the comic on which is based the tape, I have not read and not be if it is as incoherent as the movie itself but if they dare to plan an end so cheesy and on par so implausible nor is it among my absolute priorities. Not to mention that for narrative questions the vampire can attack in a nanosecond or advance to slow down the street (only will be the case if the type you want to attack the prota and takes the axe ready).Not only is flagging the little credible end if not the rest of the pieces of the puzzle starting with Josh Harnett, former teen idol and stale actor ever there, which possibly has decided to remove the title of worst actor in history to Ben Affleck imitating all their bad movements; the rest of the cast and in some cases dialogs more own a comedy to a horror film pseudo gore as the before us.Certainly not advisable for nothing.</body>
