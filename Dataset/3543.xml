	<summary>Poor Spanish, considered cult film out there.</summary>
	<body>"A real estate agent has strange dreams where it appears a very attractive young woman who lives in a faraway island". Go to the psychiatrist, who tells him that he needs a vacation. So he moved to this island where, effectively, live girl with dream, Nadine, an aristocratic descendant of Count Dracula. A passionate relationship is established between the two motivated because it is the girl of the island of a vampire, who is transformed to the girl in one like her. But her boyfriend and psychiatrist will try to save her.Although considered cult in some sectors, it is indeed a boring and inconsistent film, happily directed, that Yes, Jesus Franco, very nice patriotic director but excessively overvalued.Here are based on a good idea, but their development is a difficult to bear lead. Slow and infuriating, in addition to fairly ridiculous, only highlights its art direction, something that always has been commitment good Jesus. Moreover, quite boring and tedious, but made with a good aesthetic taste, I repeat. I do not think much, the truth.</body>
