	<body>The FOX figures sink is more than obvious. Others produce (and increasingly more often) true JUMBLES (dícense "Night at the Museum", "Eragon".) the FOX is no longer what it was. In fact, his last great taquillazo was "Ice Age II", in 2006, that even raising 650 million did shadow competition (being, for example, more than 100 million of "The Da Vinci Code" and to more than 400 of "Pirates of the Caribbean II" ".")"The Simpsons: the movie" was not a risky bet. The more sympathetic family of television would have to arise effect at the box office. The FOX began to dream (and how) and to "imagine" the profits from this film (in box office) were placed over the 720 million dollars. And today, many months since its release, the film will doubtfully 530 million.After these data (trivia, rather), talk about the film.Define "Los Simpsons: the movie" is very simple: 6 chapters of the series on a "common grounds". In fact, the film is not more than a rehash of situations that we have seen a thousand times in the series. How many times have Homer and Marge fought? How many times have ended on the edge of divorce to end up understanding that for the other are made? How many times have saved the world the Simpsons? How many times have they repeated the same gags, causing the same laugh in public.? COUNTLESS.Why the movie is this: a very long chapter (happens very quickly), very entertaining and produces the same sensation that viewing of a chapter.</body>
