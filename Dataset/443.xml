	<body>It begins to lose Tony Scott, that after the great fire of revenge now returns to his characters in salons hotels that point some bellows to others while he puts a music parody aspect. The story of Domino Harvey, I suppose that at this stage I'm already all know, me going to jump. Scott continues filming more levels than Michael Bay and still saturate colors and different racords the screen.The script lacks importance, because the plot is so confusing as loose, and the characters fail to connect with the spectator. Well, of Keira if, but by his Angel face basically. To forget the "sex scene", almost as sonrojante as the Alone in the dark, just that more cool.Echoes of Kill Bill, his previous film (these dancers subtitles) and true romance in a tape in which highlights are (care) Ian Ziering, Brian Austin Green (you sound like?) and credits. (the initial and the final, splendid). A 4.</body>
