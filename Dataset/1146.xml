	<body>Simple comedy, with some other dotted, that explores the basis of an episode of the classic Warner, one in which Baby Herman (famous for his reappearance in "Who framed Roger Rabbit") gets involved in house of a few gentlemen that confuse him with a baby. After this madness are the Wayans Brothers, famous for their rendition of "Scary Movie" or "Two blondes hair on chest", the staff side to emphasize the presence of the blonde Brittany Daniel, which have seen in countless comedies. The film certainly won't to history, since that from beginning to end is more absurd, rallante and uncouth than one might expect, but anyway, are 90 min. entertaining, which, a priori, they forget as they visionan.
