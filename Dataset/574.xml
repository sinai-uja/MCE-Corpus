	<body>Pass a good time this morning watching the thrilling (has no other adjective) Running scared here, the Parrot, the proof of the crime. And it is a movie with possibilities, what happens is that during its one hundred and twenty minutes there is time for (many) good things and bad things (many).The case is that the movie, filmed with nerve by Wayne Kramer, who already gave us three years ago the estimable The Cooler, sins, especially in its first half hour, excessive (could say something like "choked the viewer based on all kinds of postpro clichés"), but then takes it with slightly (but only slightly) more than calm.Among the numerous successes of the film is the sequence that takes place in the House of marriage that "welcomes" Oleg, simply masterly. I do not say anything else at this sequence. Well Yes, that David Lynch sure he likes.Paul Walker not clashes (something that had browsed around) and are welcome to see Palminteri on the big screen, but do always of. As I said, that to spend two hours entertaining can be recommended over this month. A 7.PD: pity to have half a dozen of late and a couple of the usual traps of the scene of the modern thriller, the last of them pa kill them all (screenwriter, producer and director, although insurance that the blame is the second).</body>
