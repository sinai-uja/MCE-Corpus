	<summary>Funny film of intrigue that deserved better luck. Intelligent, although rather strange film of intrigue. It is actually a comedy, although it does too much grace.</summary>
	<body>"A psychiatrist is hired to deal with the very President of the United States." The acceptance for it is a challenge, but little by little check such work takes away all the freedom that possessed. Before this, he decides to escape. "But both the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. and foreign powers want to capture him or kill him, before qu rebel secrets told the President".Intelligent, although rather strange film of intrigue. It is actually a comedy, although it does too much grace. However, history has a chance, and James Coburn does very well. But overall, the tape is not another Thursday. Criticism has always said this film which has a delusional and unexpected end. The first thing is true, but the second thing better not speak.But technical aspects, as the Mise en scène, with good lighting and sound montage as well as art direction, are worthy and have a patina of originality. At least they depart from normal, until then.A movie that could have been better, but that is at least bring something new to the film of political intrigue.</body>
