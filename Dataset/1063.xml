	<body>It should pay attention to the details inspired from this movie. From the first table is an intense experience. Very inspired by film noir and detective stories. But also in David Lynch and Sergio Leone. Rian Johnson also built a peculiar universe by placing the drama high school {in the Institute do?}. All stains of teenage angst.Uses the rhythms and forms of Hammett but recaptured fresh and new. For example the language, there are phrases taken directly from the Maltese Falcon as the signal must give the girl in the parking lot "Long." Short. Long. "Short". But there are others like this "you say to Jed so he was eaten, not to feed yourself". They are not only clever phrases, they show who is Brendan, the protagonist, that his ex-girlfriend describes him as, "he sits there back and hates everyone". Brendan infiltrates between the mafia to move drugs to find out what happened to his girl. The interpretation of Joseph Gordon-Levitt is great, and never falls in caricature, or parody. It is a complex, weak, and brave but not necessarily noble character. Survives its good beatings. Lukas Haas is the typical bad layer and cane, but rather than negotiate with bourbon in a classroom, does it in the kitchen of his mother with cereal and Apple juice.Rian Johnson wrote a short novel that has now made public on the internet first, and it took him 6 years making the film. Her funded his friends and his family. This is definitely film copyright, but copyright movie buff. You should see on the big screen and putting attention not to miss any detail. Moreover, I am sure that it should be more than once.</body>
