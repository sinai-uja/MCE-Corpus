	<body>Lo Ãºltimo de Roberto Benigni is one of those movies that I possibly thing if he had not left the cinema with the feeling of seeing again "life is beautiful". I'm sorry, but comparisons are odious, and it is impossible not to see the parallels between the two. Nobody understand me wrong; "The Tiger and the snow" I liked. A heart-warming love story, brutal part of a war, and a very entertaining film. But it is more of the same, and with worse results. The concentration camp of "life is beautiful" becomes an Iraqi hospital, affection towards a child becomes love towards a woman, and humor and hope as a weapon in a tough situation are repeated in the two films. In addition, Roberto Benigni is like Woody Allen: always plays the same character - and I like Woody Allen, but that is something that cannot be denied. If, as in this case, the movie is also similar, the result was disappointing. The few who have not seen "life is beautiful" you will find a beautiful film that mixes humor and tragedy with ability. That they have seen, it is possible that, like me, think that this time has not treated with as much sensitivity a subject so delicate - and current-, the script is not so well resolved, the histrionic Italian is already burdensome and that, Furthermore, the end lacks power, is precipitated and wasted created tension. In any case, but does not create that is bright, it seems a good option for who wants to see something interesting in the film.</body>
