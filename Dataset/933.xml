	<body>The illusionist strokes of film in height a lot has and contains moments when that excellence is crisp and clear. On the other hand, the magician is a film's commercial spirit, equipped after a commercial argument calmly drawn mounted, and executed as a wholly commercial film. That the commercialism is a burden for the sublime makes us subtract epithets to this tape of Neil Burger, although well look, referred to with aftertaste of having spent two hours of pleasure in a movie theater, the illusionist is a product back, enjoyable in all their masks, which has some, and easily recommended for two types of public: one that does not lose any candy and going to the movies by ethical obligation (and Ã©stetica)(, and moral, and vital) and one that is not never. For that last, is the magician and, maybe, he sneaks the bug of drop from time to time by a movie theater: they are dark, have magic, such as the scene in which Eisenheim (Edward Norton) work their wonders and inoculated in the viewer a more enduring, more slow, slow venom.Very intelligently completed, despite the fact that at some point it seems that everything is going to go to hell, the illusionist convinces with a playful, sentimental and human competent, credible proposal (despite the fantasy of butterflies, scarves disappear and the spectral emanations that populate the stage of the Wizard).The story is good, but Navy tricks, on screen, in the script, in the words that are said to be and in the gestures made: homage to the magic, in these times of sober minimalism or fire of infographic artifice in the film proposals calling the audience to the film. The illusionist is a worthwhile term medium in a limbo of dignity so that all paledeemos, without fanfare, without the flourish of the goer gourmet that everything puts buts, tape (I insist) charming, and the word has Fund and a dove flies the sky of the page and drops a Platypus.Ballast in their says, by a not overly clear political history (nor is its purpose: could not), the tape is left wanting for the absolute clarity of Exposition to reel off the history: gives equal to appreciate to inquire into the history a little Burger to lie a little. The film or literature manipulate reality to suit: they deform her amplify, arroban the legitimate right to speculate and here, that is abundantly clear, there is speculation, and much.I conclude with a final thought: Paul Giamanti, this step is going to be my favorite actor. Edward Norton is good (without more) as the magician in love and Jessica Biel, the beloved, is a nice vase in a Rococo table. In these times in which films are not made, it will make time.
