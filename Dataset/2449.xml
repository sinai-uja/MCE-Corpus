	<body>For a good caspista, as it is a server, there are chains and concrete programmes which are essential in your life. We cannot have a complete caspoteca, since alicatariamos the Hall only deuvedeses and more deuvedeses. In addition, a DVD is one thing cold and lifeless, which often requires breaks for commercials or even gatherings of brainy fellow members as Carmen Sevilla. For this nothing better than our neighborhood film (what the pianist of stop?). I recently discovered that in Castilla-la Mancha TV, all the weekends we enliven with the best of the best of Iberian film dandruff. Long life to both.The film is about a greater Lord called Fermín (Paco Martínez Soria) who has to impersonate a acaudala and Brazilian lady, to do a favor to a friend (Charles). The thing is is entangled, Fermín trying to escape, Carlos avoiding him with these a zagalas good to see, a suitor of evil, a director of Bank, the true acaudala and other ingredients needed for a comedy of entanglement.It goes without saying that this was the last film of the great Paco Martínez Soria and is an adaptation of a play. I was very surprised to see don Paco not dressed as a woman, if not with more hands than an Octopus trying to sobetear to the grannies mocicas accompanying him to thinking that it is women. The plot is interesting, typical comedieta where things will enrevesando more and more and more until you reach a point where everything explodes or someone puts things in place.In short, last film of Paco Martínez Soria, where their dress women Arts offers. Fun comedieta, perhaps old-fashioned, surely that satisfies his staunchest admirers. He personally amused me.</body>
