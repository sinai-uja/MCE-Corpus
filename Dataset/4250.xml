	<summary>It is a bullshit movie, but at least you laugh.</summary>
	<body>Juntes√© the film "Dead or Alive" with "The Quest" of Van Damme, aportese all the nonsense that can put in a tape based on ping pong and we already have the enesima tontuna arrival of the USA, we have tapes on "Balon prisoner" (Dodge Ball), and now on the table tennis, as well as with Dan Fogler, Christopher WalkenGeorge Lopez and Maggie Q.A Dan Fogler saw you yesterday with Jessica Alba in "Good Luck Chuck", as Christopher Walken begins to be worrisome, since it begins to appear in any film, perhaps believing that only their presence a project comes "palante", the funny of Latin origin George Lopez and the actress bellisma Eastern Maggie Q.El argument does not give much, the script either, and situations, do not give for more typical tape to get the brain out, should not ask more, frankly is of those movies that when they finish one reconnects with the real world and cares 3 noses that has seen on-screen.In short: It is a bullshit movie, but at least you laugh.</body>
