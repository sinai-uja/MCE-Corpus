	<summary>A sincere plea to return to be children, a look back at maturity, and a simple one, slow and at the same time effective way to translate what, in many other films, do not know how to do it.</summary>
	<body>From the first time I had contact with this tape knew that it was going to be different, as well I have seen in my feelings some have children, little adult, but that mix all the concepts that makes that you one as well, continue viewing hoping to more, since that way you have, perhaps for kids of the House explain barely in that is that "go" (I I had to learn when) (my grandfather "was", perhaps the person most good that I've seen in my life.), which is sometimes, too deep for kids and too infant for elders, but with good doses of fantasy and realism (almost 50%) leaves a strange regustillo to complicity in the armchair.It is true that, and say that for adults, is better to sit down to see her leaving prejudice, and is that, in these holiday times, all must be a little more kids, and enjoy sometimes recalling these dates in which being dwarf we lived like crazy with the illusion of gifts (Kings or Santa Claus, as appropriate) and with those toys that made us spend hours killed in the room of our Houseonly, only thus, can we, not only understand references dissolved in the film by its director, but in addition, leaving the film with a tender child smile from ear to ear.There are already many occasions that I usually refer to a "Quasi-theatrical" tape of those that just they have a development, there is much dialogue, and could be made perfectly in the solid structure of a theatre, is, is one of these films, given that until the few special effects for the same stranger on the other hand in a tape where "Magic Shop" is almost one characterthey are a simple and at the same time so beautiful invoice could be developed in this area.A plea to return to be children, a look back at maturity, and a simple, slow and at the same time effective way to translate what, in many other films, do not know how to do it; I like to see that Zach Helm being his films to a cinema that will be the envy of other directors such as Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry and similar. The future is full of young people wanting to give the film a "new-look".I'll take his Score with that melody that even though repetitive gets you in the depths of the "brains" and with the spectacular interpretation of Dustin Hoffman, (I have read who likened its role to Willy Wonda played by Depp), that converts to Mr.Magorium in this juguetero all have known as children and with which we loved to share our small wishes (Sr.Cuadrado in my case).Leaving aside the character played by Hoffman eccentric or is upside down? Natalie Portman this normal in its sauce, restrained, without showing much too much, or not enough, has moments where it seems more immersed in his character and others which in their eyes shows he cares little what happens on screen, then we have to Jason Bateman (this man I has fallen ill always) and lately appears up in the soup (this time voiced by my great friend Luis Posada in the dub), and finally the small Zach Mills which seems the real version of the protagonist of "Monster House".I conclude with a phrase from Hoffman who loved me: your life is an opportunity, it is used.</body>
