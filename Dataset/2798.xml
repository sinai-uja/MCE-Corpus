	<body>Rob Zombie is better director than musician. After the great House of the thousand corpses and while hope their particular version of the classic John Carpenter Halloween review, in the form of director´s cut, his second work.Three minutes shorter than the version released in theaters the movie is, as not, dirty, cruel, bloody and full of dust. Boot, the first nearly fifteen minutes, credits included, are pure Peckinpah but not only by the frozen frame, no, not we go wrong. Share with the old master pleasure by the ambiguous by the anti-hero characters, although here the anti-hero is a Satanic family of serial killers.And it is in danger. The story of revenge from a madero (genius William Forsythe) brother of the poli died in the best sequence of the prequel original leaves in its infancy of father courage, what happens that this estimated worst consequences. Before that, memorable dialogue between police and film critic that gives title to this chronicle.Unforgettable Sid Haig and above all a mansónico (or mansoniano) Bill Moseley. And those jeans of Sheri Moon. With a mad desire to see Halloween, do be in Sitges?</body>
