	<body>Is already here Will Smith to disrupt the Christmas box office, taking advantage of the pull of the novel of Richard Matherson, highly recommended to the tape, we have Mr. Smith on his umpteenth tape where exercises of Saviour of the world, although this time, it is slightly different from everything what has been done to us for a time this part, althoughafter previous as "Independence Day" "MIB" and similar one expected much more of Will (even that his voice is always, something that it has not happened here).We find ourselves before, as I have already said umpteenth grossing bomb, but seeking equal treatment both habitual consumer of action cinema popcorn maker, with the cult of reader of novels, out of the film I found the position to listen to the 2 sides (whom they had loved, that they had not read the novel) and those who were horrified by the little affection that Matherson lyrics had moved to the screen.It is also true that, in this case, in the trailers already showed us perfectly what they would teach on screen, and is, as says my best friend Isa, today, these "mini - I" movies, show more than what would be interested to see or hear the same (thanks to along with the screening have put us excellent trailers of "Crimes of Oxford" and "The Dark Knight"); Should begin to boycott the producers of Trailers?The cast is short, aside from Will, we find Alice Braga, niece of the famous Brazilian actress Sonia Braga, with which it shares artistic surname, and Charlie Tahan small and Willow Smith, think Will is getting little by little to their children the bug for the performance, the first being his son in "In search of happiness" and now his daughter, that, that, sweeping to House.Is true that the tape is full of Visual effects, given that the risk of New York deserted, as "The dark seekers" require such effects, and manage to impress (and scare, equal parts) to the audience, but if we only manage to save a film by "a few things" bad will. Ah! I can not forget me "Last man alive", which was the first adaptation of the novel that now brings us, and where a great Charlton Heston to honors killing vampires (which even gave more bad feeling that these).Finally, a tape that will crush lockers, but that will no longer cold to the fans of the novel in which it is based, including myself, and know that it is easy to leave the film saying the ubiquitous "I liked more the book."</body>
