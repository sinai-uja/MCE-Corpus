	<summary>Forget the Green OGRE so overrated, or endangered animals or wild zoos: Monster House is the best animated movie in years.</summary>
	<body>You remember when you had twelve years and saw for the first time an amazing gang? Or when you were sixteen and went to the cinema to see lost boys? Well I if I remember, and I remember the sensations I had watching these movies, and what fun that was the film then. That's the word that explains what is Monster House: fun.Animated horror movie macabre enough for acongojar to a small criaturita of the Lord, full of detallazos and, above all, good film, becomes an instant classic from the first viewing.Fortunately, and following the criterion of Amblin (Zemeckis and Spielberg produced, only this time producing well), there is no "stars" in the dub, there are actors, and it is appreciated that also it they have been carried out in the Spanish version. Original voices, to Steve Buscemi, Maggie Gyllenhaal (you know who it is, her character is just), Jason Lee (brief role, but as cool.) (It was also the smug of the Incredibles) or Jon Heder providing his voice to a geek that has little to envy to its Napoleón Dinamita. And and you will see that big is Kathleen Turner doing. well, now what you will see.Seriously, not let pass the opportunity to see a movie of truth, only be animated. Forget the Green OGRE so overrated, or endangered animals or wild zoos: Monster House is the best animated movie in years. It was explained above. A 9.PD: Yeah, the incredible is also a 9, but Aladdin is the best movie of cartoon history!</body>
