	<summary>The God of small things, that little God that not attributed to any religious doctrinaire, guide this secular Catechism of irrepressible vital breath. A masterpiece, an absolute masterpiece.</summary>
	<body>This was a boring man, a taciturn, frankly boring life, proud bureaucrat have not missed a single day to work in 30 years of performance. He was a man without options, without desires, desire to thrive without consent no novelty that tambalee this routine beautiful, unchanged, all large and small pains of the world outside. He was a man without priorities, always surrounded by mountains of papers, in a monumental crisis, which he is unknown, because simply not reason the sorry state of his gray existence. This is a man who receives the news of her cancer. And how this revelation infused life its shake-up precarious, its unfortunate demise and their monotonous transit for days. Here is when Watanabe, the revitalized ill, decides to make "social work" and built a park in the neighborhood.To learn to love the film, must see this film and prendar of formal perfection and the lyricism of the scene of the swing (and the sad song) or the concatenation of the subjective of the own Watanabe level and his son watching how a cart carries the casket of the mother. live! It is also a film of Kurosawa, full of very brief flashbacks of fragmentary notes of the plot, which seems, at times, an Italian neorealism film full of Japanese.So who thought Kurosawa was Rashomon or the seven Samurai or the hidden fortress, here also has a gem to the Capra, an absolute Ode to life, despite the sadness so great that it is found in the long footage from the tape. !Masterpiece!(And to be the first classical Japanese film this scribe has seen, the thing has begun with excellent right foot) More and better tomorrow.</body>
