	<body>There are movies that we feel a series of fascination (why insofar as I write this word I remember an item of R.E.M. called Fascinating?) staff, a magic that surrounds them, films that have not a priori come accompanied by the time-tested and dare I call "sacrosanct" promotion campaign, those that we enter through the eyesthey crowd us the look and do we do finally fall into the temptation of viewing them although at first were not interested in them not going! I am referring to small films, tender, intimate, great, however, that fill us with much more than big studios and large budgets, astronomical and similar figures. And I want to talk about "Little miss sunshine" Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, who sincerely been my everything a film discovery and one of the great films of the past 2006. Winner of the prize of the public at the last festival of S.Sebastian and performed by Steve Carell, Toni Collette, Paul Dano, Greg Kinnear, Alan Arkin, Beth Grant, Abigail Breslin, sister of the young child actor Spencer Breslin. Once I've been able to watch her, I have to say that the film is amazing, of these that you fill from beginning to end, it is true that it is a wonder that surrounds you and not know how to express the impressive feeling that accompanies you, love, pleasure, complicity, affection towards the characters. However it is be there seeing how the things happen and enjoy like crazy with what is happening, slowly, slowly but surely. Finishing, do you a favor to the senses and take a look, certainly worthwhile! For once in life make you case and make me case!</body>
