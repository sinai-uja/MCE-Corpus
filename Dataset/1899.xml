	<summary>Imperfect, addictive, at the end of the escape is a film within the film, black film, classical resonances but here incorporated in agitated 1960s in Paris... A gem!</summary>
	<body>They were the times of the Cahiers du Cinema. Nouvelle vague. Truffaut. Chabrol. Sartre, Camus, Existentialism, the Algeria war: not a moveable feast. The first foundations of a unstoppable consumerist society. Humphrey Bogart flying over the dormers of the Latin quarter. A blonde with short hair and tight black selling in the Champs Elysées Herald Tribune meshes. A Merry bon-vivant, Playboy gañán and atolondrado, verbose and sentimental, he transgress without malice and that, invariably, grant you any sympathy. At the end of the escape, death in the asphalt, the betrayal. Before: a beautiful black-and-white: Paris has never been filmed in this way. Before: a love story climb naïve of tone at the time. Inside: a Greek tragedy or a Shakespearean drama. Jean Paul Belmondo is a Hamlet of the underworld, a declared fan of the black gender archetypes that offer films that shadowed in his life journey. Jean Seberg is absolutely timeless beauty, the beauty and an image that exceeds the rigour of the years. Bebop: syncopated jazz, jazz newly lighting in America salpimentando the agile movements of the camera, which seems to also move as spurred by music. Stealth love, secret love, love fou. The flight to Rome, that won't be possible. Non-renewable betrayal. Out of breath. Michel Poiccard cares a little about dying: only wants to sleep with her American girl.</body>
