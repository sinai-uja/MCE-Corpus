	<body>Sky High is a film that somebody has to recommend to the public, because the criticism will not do so. They will prevent it serious reasons: is fun, refreshing, easy-going and exciting. If connoisseurs will pass it well with things as well would be misunderstandings and different and superior to other worldly viewers like you and like me.The film is made with two different materials: (The Incredibles) superhero films and the student dramas (bad girls). Will Stronghold is son of a superhero and father superhero, and is afraid of her first day at the Institute of superheroes because it doesn't have any superpower. You afraid to disappoint them. And this is true. In the test to decide that class will, Will has just sent to the class of the curritos that are the assistants of the superheroes (Sidekicks in English). Will he becomes friends with the other currito and just preferring them true heroes.The student drama consists of Will have to choose between the beautiful and the ugly, heroes and the curritos. The Institute teaches to develop the powers of the boys, but some do for good and others for evil. The enemy of Will is another child whose father was arrested for his own. The outcome is shot in the history of superheroes, not in student key, key and a pity because it leaves average half of social conflicts for bailouts. I am waiting with impatience the second part to see if it focuses more on the other side.</body>
