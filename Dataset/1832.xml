	<body>I have seen this movie in my house again, went to see the film in his day, and follows pareciendome an excellent film. And it is not only because the plot, the excellent performance deDaniel Brühl of the actresses who performed the role of her sisters, a better every day Tristan Ulloa, Leonor Watling (one of my weaknesses), Ingrid Rubio (a totally wasted by Spanish Cinema actress) and a great Leonardo Sbaraglia.La photography and the recreation of these years in which the dictatorship started to give blows is very good. For my best part is the initial, where is Catania as formed the anarchist group, MIL, that is reprehensible in his acts (still have to live in those years to better understand), in his ideas is certainly understandable, and in his struggle, his courage and his audacity to remain outside the scope of the entire police apparatus of Franco.Una time in the x'cacelDaniel Brühl and Leonardo Sbaraglia rise the interpretative level to very high levels. Brilliant transformation of the second, basketball in the courtyard of the jail, talks,. But a scene that makes the movie is the arrival of the executioner of the garrote vil and the final scene of his execution. Cruel, scary and infinitely sad and real.Relationship with Leonor Watling is interesting, but the really important relationship has been with Ingrid Rubio. As I said one of the best and least used of Spanish cinema, that good it is.In conclusion a stupendous film that reminds us that there are many reasons why living but also many ideas which worth dying.</body>
