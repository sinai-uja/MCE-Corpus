	<body>Formidable comedy about the complications in a relationship. Maurice Chevalier is the best private detective in Paris, the city of love. His daughter, Ariane (Audrey Hepburn), lives fascinated with the glamorous world of illicit lovers known to imply through the archives of his father. One day Chevalier informs a client that his wife deceives him with magnate Frank Flannagan (Gary Cooper) and the man rises in his search to kill him. Ariane decides to prevent Flannagan without explaining the reasons, leaving him fascinated by the mystery. Taking advantage of their knowledge of the life of the playboys, Ariane conquers the womanizer Frank making him believe (and suffer) is a girl so experienced and scheming like him. Daring for its time, in this movie Wilder criticizes the moral double of a society that entroniza monogamy but lives pending of the alcove of the famous secrets. Preventing problems with censorship, images of a solitary forest allude splendidly the sexual encounter between lovers. Perhaps for the public today's the age difference between Cooper and Hepburn is somewhat difficult to digest, but remember, were the 1950s. Be a playboy took her years.</body>
