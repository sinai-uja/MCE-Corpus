	<body>An arreglatejados, poor as a rat, discover of the pirate killed with the plane of the island with the fabulous treasure chest. Does not cut hair and paw to hell: that is 13 Tzamenti, a journey into the depths of the human soul horror. Paranoia, madness, shaking, a Hostel to the gross: the film that combines the spirit of fashion Saw any of their deliveries and a point to the Polanski of the principle when filming without scruples and made perverse portraits of the ambitions and the strict code of ethics of evil in its purest form (Cul-de-Sac and then, less soundly Chinatown).There is a raw, intimate tone, but there are also patterns of the thriller: everything very well seasoned of convincing arguments as the irreproachable (novel) script in trite that everything in this write things to the film or the performance of Sebastian, the protagonist, a fine and, for me, unknown George Babluani, who speaks in a gesture or a silence between a sentence and one that other actors worth with a Parliament of three minutes.Black and white suits these troubled feelings, handled with cold desperpajo by a novel director who promises (and long). (Eye to their new, announced, L'Heritage). Recommended for those who wish to attend a meeting of well-written adrenaline, powerful writing of classic film noir, but transmuted (despite the appearance to the former) in absolute modernity. A discovery backed by a huge string of awards.</body>
