	<body>I have gone to deceive, I that expected me a space sex film and is which is a thriller. And it is that not you can rely only on titles. Moreover, the poster makes us see that we are faced with a meat of neighborhood video store shelf title. By the way, the very successful, since title is referred to a precise moment in the film that could well have been overlooked, in my humble opinion.The film is a partner with daughter are tempted by a gordo buy a plot. Between, kill a man that has relationship with the Government, and need a head of Turkish, fuck this couple. Total, who without eat it or drink it is put in a tremendous story about corruption in Mexico and what you can do to conserve power.Division of views within the family, given that my medium kiwi seemed horrible and I am not displeased me. As film of intrigue is good, given that maintains the tension until the end. Moreover, when just not finish very be convecido that that should be the end and you expect to happen even more. The argument is not original, but without special effects hits you to seat, although leaving you a little squashed. On the subject of actors, we have everything. Almost all are very credible, except the main character, which not is if was because I remembered a friend, but did me too making it. The trouble is that it is very sad and sobering.In short, a bad film roll pretty well executed, but to do with morality. After this, I doubt that any family with baby comes to mind to go to Mexico on vacation.</body>
