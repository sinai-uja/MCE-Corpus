	<summary>Omen you that your poster could never predict long Cruise, Streep much, much Redford, but a short career in the Spanish cinemas.</summary>
	<body>Lions for Lambs is one of those disappointments that are seen to come from afar. Maybe the irregularity of Tom Cruise when choosing roles and political diatribes of Redfort that lately it is not quite right and when he gets behind the camera is petulant and doctrinal to be tedious and sleepy.Several things not just materialize on the tape. The first is the error structure segments to address the political pamphlet: a Professor trying to take their students on the right track, some soldiers in full military operation and a Senator trying to sell the success of a military political strategy to the press. It does not fit. It is well orchestrated but has a Hollywood tufo remaining sensationalism to the proposal which is far from being a plausible. Now it is fashionable to say that war is evil. There are many ways to do so, in this film not have risked and have done so from all points of view, you see the war, you speak of the war and even justify you the war but in the end the European viewer not biting the hook of a bet rather mediocre when compared with the rest of the doctrinal anti-war films of the you recently.In fact, with this premise I omen you that its poster could never predict long Cruise, Streep much, much Redford, but a short career in theaters Spanish political cinema.? No, desktop cinema.</body>
