	<body>Paul Weitz (American Pie) continues its maturation process with American Dreamz, a brave blow to the image of George Bush ("I did political to prove to my father that any idiot could do it"); the attitude of some press; to the society capable of any stupidity in order to get the fame, and the programs offered by this short-lived possibility to change people extract their innards to exhibit them in the television showcase. Perhaps spend too much time on the least mind, the songs of the contest, but Mandy Moore is a star in the U.S. and must pay the price.However, what is a novelty is that they have been so direct in his satire: after a process of makeup, actor Willem Dafoe, which cannot be further physically of Dick Cheney, is practically stuck to the Vice President.
