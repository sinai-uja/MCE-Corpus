	<body>The third part of Caribbean pirates is a cierre(¿?) worthy of the trilogy, it replied to questions that was left in the air in the second part. Entertainment and fun are guaranteed, thanks to the great performance by Johnny Depp, with his unique style makes the Pirate Jack Sparrow one of the funniest characters I've seen ever, is only for him worth seeing this film, although at times it may be a little child. Completely opposite is the performance of Orlando Bloom, as deadpan as always, is clear that his presence only serves to the delight of quinceañeras and fans.The film is quite long, and until he makes his surreal appearance (best film) Jack Sparrow becomes a little heavy, then the story takes place with a frenetic pace and the plot becomes confused and tangled, as happened in the second part, there comes a time when it is not known who is betraying who, or what characters are in a ship or another.You can enjoy quite seeing this film, although it is clear that it is not a great movie and that there is really absurd and pathetic, scenes such as the wedding on the boat.</body>
