	<body>The typical film jam, starring an actor Jam (with see the face to Justin Long one is well aware that it is a jerk fledged), and with an argument as jam possible.Above produces Tom Shyadac, usual in Jim Carrey filmography (comedies), and responsible for Ace ventura and other comics.The argument is laughable, since I do not understand this custom USA of being "cool" or "popular" or go to College, server here wasn't to the Faculty (or enrolled go) and do not think that my life is better or worse for it.A movie for geeks, where the more morons of the panorama walk through it making the bobo, and where, for all the female bait that appears, no a single breast or provocative situation (oops, that until missed it).And above with a finale of trials of those who like both in the USA where calls to the happy ending.</body>
