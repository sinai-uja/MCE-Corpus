	<summary>A title of film noir, made in Argentina and sifted for the pleasure of the audience of the 21st century: Honorable is this experience even though it can to end not convince as round film.</summary>
	<body>The truth is that sometimes we are too demanding and allow ourselves to take hubristic and overloaded analysis. These adjectives we cannot apply them to the work of Ricardo Darín and Martín Hodara directors, so we huiremos of critical pedants quibble that praises the film genre after destroy any attempt to show something new. Different and new. That is this film could not see completed its promoter, Eduardo Mignogna. It is a story written by him with great skill and moved to images after be underpinned by more classic patterns while taking advantage of all the technical and artistic resources that provides the film today. The whiff to cinema of time is present at all times, although Diego Peretti and Julieta Díaz - without being the 'femme fatale' which aims to-, and Darín in his facet as an actor, get print a slight breath of fresh air to his interpretations.As experiment okay, especially knowing the factors that have determined the outcome, but perhaps as a film, and taking our most severe side, Miss you something: can to lighten a somewhat convoluted story, avoid certain rate decreases. The best, no doubt, interpretation, also photography and the atmosphere in general: return to Buenos Aires in 1952 had not to be an easy task for those responsible for this unusual directorial debut. It is worthwhile to accompany them.</body>
