	<body>It may be a silly day or may be after seeing what I've seen fairly acceptable anything becomes something good and recommended, but the case is that Vacancy has seemed to me, among other things, a very honest film.Variant of the saga of Roth, of 8 Mm or the debut of Alejandro Amen치bar this thriller of 81 minutes including credits beginning and end can be seen with great ease.A couple in crisis and on the verge of divorce, a wrong way and a road motel run by a Robby Krieger that turns out to be an important hijoputa are the ingredients.The couple protagonist carries the entire weight of the film and they are pretty well the two.The movie does not provide neither more nor less than what it promises and that in the times runs is appreciated.</body>
