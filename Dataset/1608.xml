	<body>New movie Alejandro González Iñárritu Puzzle, this time less mixed than "21 grams" and more of the style of his first tape "Amores Perros", with a series of frames, some collected by hairs, seeking, through harsh images, attract and plotted the Viewer.Honestly the movie found me bella on your Bill, well constructed, but very boring, with few moments coming to sink in the retina of the Viewer, on the other hand, both Pitt, like Blanchett, as the rest of the actors including Gael García Bernal and Elle Fanning (Dakota little sister), are normal, palatable and following his line of typical performance.Of all the stories (linked by a link to each one more jam), I'll perhaps stick with Japan and Morocco, both perhaps the most complicated and hard, a separation of cultures and because of his harsh at times, but not I have never reached shudder in the armchair.Regard to the soundtrack of Gustavo Santaolalla, which has won an Oscar, again I hear the everlasting Melody with guitar, I perhaps stayed with the collaboration of Ruichi Sakamoto, sometimes enlarging a Score, which is tiny.In short, a film that has been given so much hype that it is impossible to be impartial with her.</body>
