	<body>To speak of "Zodiac" the first thing to do is to speak of childhood of its director, my always beloved David Fincher, is that, being a more tender infante, and living in S.Francisco, he had to go through terror or horror be threat of this ruthless serial killer, did not become a trauma for the little David, but if something that marked him and that sooner or later proposed having, already on his first tape "Sev7en" spoke of serial killers, and here in "Zodiac" (which has nothing to do with his first film) returns to the fray with the same subject, although from a completely different Prism, this time, to say nothing, is recreated in the Zodiac murders and if in the investigation of his "work".The truth is that there was much time not so much enjoying at a meeting of good cinema, embodied, played masterfully by Jake Gyllenhaal. that gives life to the author of the book on which is based the tape, Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards (with a wig impossible), Robert Downey Jr.y more than enough Brian Cox (this I have compared with Ed Harris, and it is only their very presence on a tape to improve more than viewing).Perhaps, as a negative note he would talk of their excessive duration, and is that at the beginning of the footage becomes in long flat, artistic and that they have little to do with the outcome of the investigation, and they drag their duration until the 160 min. and it is that one comes from the film with the more bare than a baboon butt.</body>
