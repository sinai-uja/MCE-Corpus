	<body>On September 11, 2001, the world suffered a great shock. United States was the largest terrorist attack victim and shocked virtually the entire planet. We all remember what we were doing on that fateful day, in which our eyes are posed on the TV, or our ears on the radio or people. And even after five years is still honoring victims, with films such as which we can now see in Billboard: United 93. It is not a good movie, or something that will happen to the story, what if he spent was the same event tells us, but it may be shocking view in a closer way it could have been anything. Still, the movie sins of charisma and repetitive in many moments and can get bored, they say that the ending is more entertaining, the last half-hour is fast-paced, well then, if we assume that we like blood and macabre, Yes. As I said, it is not a great film, but meets its objective, which is to gain many currencies at the expense of a "tribute to the victims" and expose what was the largest disaster that shook the world in a single day. Before we delete this image of our head, especially for those who really suffered and still suffer, are those still living tormented by the memory of that infamous event. Perhaps never be erased already history. And the distance of what happened has calmed the thirst for revenge of some, although they already left the trail of blood spread the world. But will always be on our memory the indifferent flight of an aircraft, and its subsequent explosion, marking an earlier and a later in the story.</body>
