	<summary>One adaptation of one video game so forgettable, as little appealing</summary>
	<body>I admit, without any notion of shame that the Rob Cohen film, starring Vin Diesel "xXx" is one of my recent action films that I like and that I have seen in more than one dozen occasions; nostrae is also true that this, as it is today, it was going to be also starring Diesel, but this at the last moment poured back for (anda amidst in the filming of Hannibal, which seems to have no end), and producers and others, before the expiry of them license to Eidos (the creators of the game) had sold them to move your character to the big screen, they decided to find the worst possible substitute, this is none other than Timothy Olyphant, that certainly looks bad face, nor takes on screen the pimping and ill-favored attitude that the character needs.Is also true that the shadow of Luc Besson, producer of the film here, it is elongated and that whiff to Action Center-European cinema accompanies the film and her goes so far as to burden at times, leaving aside the action made in USA who may need to stay in a laughable experiment once more, based on a video gameone can not do than sigh and murmur that the suffering lasts as little as possible.Xavier Gens, director frances of the tape seems to care little character, and in this, his first film is dedicated to walk in any type of situation seen earlier, and Hitman goes from being an agent to the most pure style 007, a mercenary of Stallone, Schwarzenegger films and even Van Damme in his best days.There have been peeled ass watching tapes of action like thumbs in hundreds of video games first thing worth (the latter is not my case) to verify that the tape of Gens is not among highlights of the genre, with an argument so sosamente bad faced (perhaps a calvo, aiy and with a bar code on the back of the skull is not locatable)that one wonders as noses someone, with 2 fingers of forehead can give you a bit of verisimilitude with reality, by my videojueguil this is, and is not enough to put a picture of the game so we see that it is.In short, that I do not want to extend in excess, one adaptation of one video game so forgettable, as little appealing.</body>
