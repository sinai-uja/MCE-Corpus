	<body>Wow, poor squirrel, how bad that was spent in the first and how bad that paints the second looking at the poster. And I still not explained as not her eaten, since you have to be already desfallecido so many adventures. What you eat? Angelico to penic which gives me (and what me rio, clear).The film is about a peculiar group, comprised of a sloth, a mammoth and a tiger of Sabre-tooths during the thaw. Given that the Valley in which they live will flood soon, all that inhabit begin a pilgrimage towards a supposed barge that will save them from the flood. By the way, mammoth suffers a crisis of loneliness, given that it realizes that he is the last of its species with life. Luckily, three zarig端ellas (a large size) intersect in their way. In parallel, a squirrel fights his Acorn all who stand in his way.Well, the movie I loved. I laughed much, I am excited and I've bored nothing at all. All the characters I have loved, and have been removed many things that I liked not to the first. The sloth is very funny, considering his stellar moment and resolviendolo in a great way (especially for kids). Saber-toothed does not have a large role, although it leaves a lesson in overcoming very interesting (a little 単o単a, but it is a film for children). And I love the mammoth, but not be well why. But best of all are the secondary characters, such as the zarig端ellas or the worshipers of the sloth. Well, I'm lying, the best of the entire film is the story of the squirrel, which is made up of wonder. I'm a fan of her since the first time that I saw, and in this part has a role critical and very long.In short, a very nice movie for kids and you like minded young adults. The trouble is that it has scenes that can be scary to the kids.</body>
