	<body>To anything today called horror film, honestly the movie is boring, pretentious, poorly shot, worse written and performed much worse, maybe the only good thing that has the movie was the news that filming the 2 actors cannot be or see that the film's story, and, as happens in other many tapes of this styleone is pulled good thinking of part of the footage as stupidly fools who are the protagonists and as you like, with some hatred that both give matarile soon better; especially when the story does not give for more.A couple that is on the verge of divorce are lost (typical) and intend to give a road Motel where it seems they spend shooting snuff film with the unsuspecting who sits there, reading these lines one need not know more than so infamous show.Or similar to thesis (already would), nor to murder in 8 mm (already would), nor to anything decent, where attempts to give a claustrophobic air, and all you get is more a comedy than a thriller horror that can give something of fear, and look that the undersigned is quite scary and easily impressionable.The soundtrack of Michael Fakesch falls into the common sounds heard over and over again on the tapes of this caliber, music that intends to enter by the ears to be scary, but is so like that honestly, it fails.Sad, bad, pretentious, with enormous failures of script is ideal for see, forget show and here nothing has happened.</body>
