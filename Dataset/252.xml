	<summary>The most successful of Isao Takahata in addition to a Summit for the genre</summary>
	<body>It has their same hallmarks as well as the signing of the Studio Ghibli, however we are not talking of Hayao Miyazaki but Isao Takahata. With races similar and occasionally shared framework (Heidi) the second has been more experimental and therefore more irregular. Grave of the fireflies is his most successful film as well as a Summit for the genre. So much so that a prestigious American critic noted that you it's a masterpiece of vision required for everyone, but especially for those who still dare to deny the bread to the animation. Children are children and need their mothers. Marco toured half world Italy Los Andes to meet yours. Seita, our protagonist, does not have that opportunity: it is possible that his parents is them has taken the World War II. Its priority must be to protect his sister, mature quickly, and lose her children so she can preserve yours. This is his sacrifice, accept responsibility and his sister can keep dreaming without hearing that his fall around bombs and dies people everywhere. Only thing good is that more than Seita in aging always to strive you it will be something of the child that was inside, that that builds a tomb with fireflies convinced that it is the best possible bunker against human barbarism.</body>
