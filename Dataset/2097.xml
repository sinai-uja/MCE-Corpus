	<summary>Do a bloody shit of film (sorry to be so clear) by which is not worth paying even a paltry?.</summary>
	<body>Mira myself cured of horror to the sum of "comedy + románticismo" but this film, I'll try to keep my my mosqueos and suspicions to another similar film, has far exceeded any type of bad expectation you could have, especially when the tape (of 2005) has taken 2 years to reach our screens, and it is that anything we happily premiered in Spain,, and say this thing as a synonym for film, but here should have much imagination to characterize this film with this little word.The actors, the vast majority of them is them most noticeable thinking of the cheque that will charge, which contribute something on screen, is more Duchovny seems to laugh in a last personal problem (addiction to sex), indeed this already coincided with Julianne Moore (in my life I have seen more freckles per square CM), in "Evolutión".Clint Mansell, which I quite like in their work with the Cronos Quartet on the soundtracks with which he has collaborated, however here is a simple (and sweetened) music selection, which barely one can withstand, prefer to listen to the great successes of Manolo escobar, than the full Score of this script experimento.¿El? Non-existent, even my nephew turned a year last week (congratulations Albertito), he could have written something better, which is that the evolution of situations, one not good, and is planted to half of the film without knowing very well by him where come shots, and more boring than a pig in a garage, todaythe price of the film does not deserve the disbursement for certain films, although we accuse then if others to spend money on other things (drugs, sex and rock &amp; roll).Anyway, and in short, bloody shit of film (feel so clear) by which is not worth paying even a paltry?.</body>
