	<summary>A mixture between Crash and Lost In Traslation. 4 stories dramatic, with solitary confinement as a theme, that if not for the non-linear way of tell rozarían a uppercase simplicity.</summary>
	<body>Last night I went to see Babel, the last of the Mexican Alejandro Gonzalez Iñarritu (21 grams, Amores Perros). Without wanting to be exhaustive, Babel is a mixture between Crash and Lost In Traslation. They are 4 stories that touch. One very slightly, which takes place in Japan, and dealing with the emotional problems of a young sordomuda who lost her mother. The other three misfortunes are fruit more or less by chance, in a bad way (as in Crash). But the stories, although more realistic that in one, they are simpler, and if it were not because they are told in a non-linear manner, would be simplistic cheap film dramas.In fact, despite the realism of the setting (the best for my), failed to excite me. Even the suffering of Mexican history seemed a bit absurd how produces.I can still say that the movie not displeased me. It is clear that the director knows mood situations to make the viewer feel like their characters. The disco in Japan scenes are an example, or the agustia of desert along the Mexican border.In short, 4 stories dramatic, in 3 places of the world, different as their nationalities, but equally helpless before the basic problems of affection or incommunicado detention. Original by the way of telling it (although if it was linear not be worth much). Rather slow in general by the emotional recreation attempt fails in my opinion, but I am sure that it will please many.</body>
