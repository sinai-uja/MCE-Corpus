	<body>Hate the biopics. I've said it many times, but I have the feeling that no one listens to me. For a lover of stories, there is no worst story than the biography of a person. The history of the "Dreams" is told to end up discovering that one of the characters was the bad. Even the worst screenwriter huviera warned the public that this type was bad in the first scene. "Dreamgirls" introduced him as a wonderful kind that helps them to climb. It is not that the writer is bad, it is what happened as well. God does not know to write scripts. I don't know why the film insists on fusil√°r them. If it charged copyright would leave him in peace, but as it does not charge, will have to continue holding biopics. And I do not know if I have said it, but I hate the biopics.The villain is so bad that his fault the singer Jimmy Early could not leave drug. It censured him a song and Early was released by his team of syringes and other tools of some that, Gee what a coincidence, had prepared in a pocket of the jacket. But if it is not for this reason, Early saves. In this movie there are many people doing harm to other people, people who saves other people, people that destroys the lives of other people. It is a film in which no one is to blame what happens, there is always a black hand. All blame the bad. The truth, I can't imagine anyone ruining my life. These tireless characters causing many casualties seem escapees of a nightmare, but I've never met the original of the portrait.</body>
