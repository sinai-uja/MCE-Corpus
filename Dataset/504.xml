	<body>After you open the animation film to provocation, Disney though moderate, with Shrek, the psychological depth, or the colegueo modern animations, it seems that cartoons public is already prepared to make another leap, and penetrate the secrets of kaleidoscopic cinema, the legacy of Citizen Kane, Rashomon or captives of the evil. When Nicky Croak police inspector arrives at the scene of the crime, he discovers that Riding Hood, Wolf, Grandma and the lumberjack have four very different versions of the same story.Cory Edwards does not reach the end of making contradictory versions of the four protagonists, does not require the Viewer to guess who of them lies. Nor get to ask the tarantiniano exercise change of sympathy with each version. It adapts the story by Perrault to the times with the omnipresence of the media and some tribute to mission impossible and forced Matrix. Also leaves behind their bobo sexual background. It is told with the intention of finding a happy ending for a rather bloodthirsty tale. And you can congratulate the authors on two turns to whether to do so.</body>
