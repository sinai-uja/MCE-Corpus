	<summary>Fincher builds a solid film in general, although the length of the tape and the rain of information, just weighing on the shoulders of the Viewer.</summary>
	<body>Although I liked, 'Zodiac' has not seemed to both, nor a work master or a memorable peliculón, but the work of the director of 'Fight club' with this film is commendable.Fincher builds a solid film in general, with a very interesting script and that is portrayed almost to perfection by the totality of its cast (large Mark Ruffalo). The address is outstanding; the Mise en scène, excellent. Attentive to the murder sequences: very realistic and well portrayed with an enviable command of the situation by the director, which in turn looks sometimes offering the flat viewer of all classes to frame.However, despite their virtues, Zodiac sins for my taste to rather long; his pace is quite irregular. That the movie is long, okay, but isn't so long that it becomes long, heavy plumbate and sometimes a, charisma.At the very moment in which the narrative hits a considerable downturn in pace, comes this saturation of information (understandable: is a detective film research.) just overflowing a tad, only digestible for people loving the genre.</body>
