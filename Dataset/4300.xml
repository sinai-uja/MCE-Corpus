	<body>The truth is I expected much more of Todd Phillips in his return to the crazy American comedy after the undervalued Road Trip, but school of pringá you is not more than bullshit in the form of film. It will pass through the ticket without penalty or glory (except for your target audience) and will go directly to the shelves of our video shops where you will probably enjoy greater success in the form of something that rent a Saturday afternoon. Only with the title - as always another bad translation - we can predict us awaits us. Certainly, you are not looking for a masterpiece in this type of film, but a minimum of entertainment and ingenious gags that will help you to disconnect during 90 minutes. And that is what lacks this feature. With a more topical humor, the film unfolds over a silly script without any spark or comical. Only the interpretation of Billy Bob Thornton - Dr.House-voice and a cameo Ben Stiller is most noticeable of this truño devoid of grace. The main character is overflowing with stupidity and indifference in equal parts, without any funny scene; which if achieved in only a couple of times some side. Typical American clichés in a comedy that adds nothing new to the genre, resulting in insusa and more predictable. Now that you can flee.</body>
