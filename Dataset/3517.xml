	<summary>Obviously the script is a hodgepodge of many genres mixed happily that it has no great consistency, anyway is typical fun dandruff and with wild moments than a whole freak loves to see.</summary>
	<body>Brett Leonard is an of these directors never caught my attention, his filmography moves in mediocrity of the kind Man Thing or Virtuosity. Only highlighting his greatest achievement with the grass cutter.Until a few hours ago always happened unnoticed his first and of course better film entitled the death pit.This madness with ZOMBIES, MAD DOCTORS, an insane asylum, memories of the past, GORE to GLUGs, are ingredients that welcome any dander video store amateur. Some actors repeated with the director as for example cheryl lawson appeared in virtuosity and Jeremy slate I collaborate in the held the grass cutter.Excellent special effects, dirty picture that sticks at all times environmentally pure hallucination that conveys the film, the music is also a well coupled to the whole instrument.The script is clearly a batí burrillo of many genres mixed happily that it has no great consistency, anyway is typical fun and wild times dandruff which all freak loves to see.</body>
