	<summary>It is poor, but funny. They are not Granger, nor Barker, but it is Cameron, a likeable actor who in the 1940s and 1950s made some good tough cowboy roles. Funny script. Beautiful Yugoslav landscapes.</summary>
	<body>"The dreaded Bandit Cyrus is willing to annoy both the peaceful inhabitants of a section of the people of the West Indian Winnetou." "This, with the help of his inseparable friend Old Firehand, will seek to prevent it".Continuation of the sympathetic adventures of the Indian Winnetou and his friend Old Firehand, entertaining adaptations of the immortal works of Karl May. Here, the reins of the film is in German hands, so the quality down considerably. It is poor, but funny. They are not Granger, nor Barker, but it is Cameron, a likeable actor who in the 1940s and 1950s made some good tough cowboy roles. Funny script. Beautiful Yugoslav landscapes.</body>
