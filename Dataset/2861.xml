	<summary>Boring, long and with a villain that makes McClane looks like history, the jungle hijoputa 4th is the worst possible sequel.</summary>
	<body>About cyberterrorists attack EEU and U and the Government sends a COP to look for a hacker. From there they await us cent thirty minutes of film blue, and that's because Len Wiseman makes blue films. And boring.If the movie entitled Total chaos and the COP responded to the name of Harry Jones would approve it far-fetched to have a couple of molona action scenes. It would probably also have blood. But not. The movie is titled the jungle 4.0 and the madero is John McClane. And that get me to the balls.Boring, lengthy (one minute longer than the first, but you know what I'm saying, right?) and a villain that makes McClane looks like history, the jungle hijoputa 4th is the worst possible sequel, adds absolutely nothing and what is worse, is loaded the hallmarks of the series.McClane seems Jeff Talley and does not carry straps and Yes t-shirt, Talley is by the hair. We moved from Sam Zeus Jackson to Justin Long, fails to plug into the character and worst of all comes with action: in the jungle 1 him bursting head to Mr Takagi in the meeting room; in the second part McClane took a look at CigarroPuro's Porky's and the third they start an uncle in half etc.There are blood if any character is cut and point. And it has thousand dead times. And spare you half an hour. And it's boring.Len Wiseman is the guy who directed Underworld and shows it in a couple of scenes, that here there is peña flying. It is the disappointment of the season and only the good a (forced) sentence which would be the best COP in the film.</body>
