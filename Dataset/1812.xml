	<body>Curious tape of film noir, set in the 1950s, that although developed in 2 levels, fails to be round because you lose on the road, and is slow at times, the inability to close the thousand plots that open and a dull finish that matters little to the Viewer, are a burden for 2 hours, he showed great promise at the beginning, but that finally is nothing.Adrien Brody is the same that we saw in "The pianist", away from the hero of "King Kong" Peter Jack$ are, on the other hand is Ben Affleck, someone once said, that after "Jersey Girl" again this man would be able to act, in "Hollywoodland" (which won the Volpi Cup at the festival of Venezia) manages to make credible the character of George Reeves"originator" of the already legendary "Superman curse", do not want to set aside to Diane Lane, which is no longer a child, but has lost none of its brutal beauty and sensuality, Amen an excellent interpretive level, which transmits on screen leaving almost "Out" to Ben and Adrien.Un campus excellent side, headed by Bob Hoskins, as well as quite a few television facesclose the deal.Another point against is your score, bland, very bland, with a boring score, arriving to the viewer a sense of permanent musical torpor.</body>
