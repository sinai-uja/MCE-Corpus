	<body>Host who grilled me just the laberinto del fauno, unbearable tale of series b that will give you all the critical prestige worldwide to its director, my dear Guillermo del Toro, but found it me sleeping.I'm fan of Cronos and Blade II, Hellboy, even Mimic, but this version of the story the shot of truth and with a pair of cojones Terry Gilliam shortly before.Aburridísima. It seems one of those games disappointing Psone, those who a decade ago you expect with desire and then is that in the background are vulgar, boring and notable.The photo, or music, or anything except the Verdú despite the accent, because Sergi is cliché.And I do short, that already has talked many people of this movie so embers. Ending Hellboy 2 one time that surely is more fun. ZZ Top is by the classical lyrics of sleep.</body>
