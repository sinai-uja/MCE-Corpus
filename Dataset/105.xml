	<body>Returning to the theme of the posters of cinema and movies that hide behind, in this case corresponds quite well. We have two people doing a sexual act, which fits very well. And the title is a play on words between "lie with me" and "acuestate with me". I.e., horns and folleteo.The film is about a girl that has an excessive sexual appetite, we, as a typical man. One day he meets a boy and he emerges a crush in what has been the crotch, so he decides to go to a field to romp with another while that liked to seen from the car while his girlfriend he sharpens the sword (of truth of the good). And start a session of amorios and folleteos (between the protagonists) for an hour and a half, showing how to change the view of the protagonist about sex and love.Well, the movie has little, very little. At a first glance, we have only a kind of low budget porn film, which is not too bad. At a second glance, we see a love story real as life itself, sex and grumo, none of roses and wine. That it is not bad. But the set does not kill, given that it doesn't end of hook. The actors do their role, but not you get on your skin at any time, especially hits the male public acts of the protagonist. We can say in its favour, which is a low-budget Canadian production, so it focuses on "cheap" aspects, but to me I did not finish like. And at the end I bored a lot.In short, for the indie film enthusiasts (or as type) or for pajilleros unrepentant who have to justify his masturbation under "serious" films.</body>
