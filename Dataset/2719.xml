	<summary>Worthy end to a trilogy that reinvents a genre as exciting as incomprehensibly relegated in the charts.</summary>
	<body>There are times that one is facing the sequel to a film with the illusion that it is, the less of a quality similar to the first. In the event that we are discussing today, I must admit that although the Bourne Identity not excited me, I was quite entertaining, back in 2002. Why two years later I hurried to watch its sequel, hoping to learn a little more of the enigmatic existence of Bourne, that boy who gives life always correct and already close to quarantine Matt Damon. However, I left quite disappointed and thinking that the topic of second parts were never good is one of those who they least hierra. On the other hand, the third installment has seemed rather more complete than the second.Perhaps due to the fact that management team headed by Paul Greengrass, which gives obvious have learned from their mistakes and offers to the public a product close and dynamic, leaving aside the artistic claims to focus on entertainment, that at the end and all is what most expect when you go to see a movie of this Court has held on this occasion.In any case, the fact of having succeeded in closing a trilogy that well could have stayed at one or two parties sufficiently well with some dignity cannot be to the credit of the study. This, in addition to the aforementioned Damon, contributes the rest of a balanced cast, featuring Albert Finney. Instead, the film should are the excessive lengthening of the plot, the fact that it is extremely predictable and claim impact forms rather than the bottom.In any case, it's an acceptable film to deal with the beginning of the end of the summer of 2007.</body>
