	<summary>Finally, he could not forget me the cameo of the great Nacho Vidal... A simple tape that is visiona and forget just as quickly.</summary>
	<body>Starting the tape in a few opening credits that slightly resemble "Atrapame" If you can of Spielberg, this vehicle for showcasing (with an argument of joke), we find for Santi Millán, Fernando Tejero and Jose Luis Garcia Sanchez (this last have seen you in "Closer" together with Belén Rueda), a soundtrack, full band of Spanish music, as well as Mastretta, with its characteristic sound.As counterpoint, or curiosity, say that Fernando Tejero Lucia during the filming some opaque lenses which prevented it from the vision, as well as the Santi Millán character seems a silent too forced for my taste, and is that I know a couple of deaf and dumb to not mark both as Millán, on the other hand, the character of Jose Luis García Sánchez reminds me of my father, led an orthopedic leg during a good part of his life, his jokes are those who have heard in the film.Finally, he could not forget me the cameo of the great Nacho Vidal. A simple tape that is visiona and forget just as quickly.</body>
