	<summary>A drama in every rule, that magnificent interpretation and the popularity of its protagonist terceto, save to a movie and make it a good movie.</summary>
	<body>I've always thought that for dramas, real life is, unfortunately, an inexhaustible source. In addition, I think the film as a way of escape the routine of everyday life and problems, and perhaps why science fiction is one of my favorite genres and the drama the less appreciated.Stay by my side is a drama in every rule, that talent and the popularity of its two main female protagonists, Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts, saved from being a TV movie.The terrible story that recounts is a separate mother is diagnosed with cancer and dedicated his last months to prepare their children to live with their farcical and his new wife, which until then had not had good relationship, but which will entrust the care of its offshoots.The interrelations between the characters, the gradual acceptance among some and others and the approach of the two women formerly faced, constitute the linchpin of this film that stretches for two hours.Being an issue so thorny and delicate, which must pass many people, the least you can ask it is concerned with the lower possible ruggedness, what we need to recognize that it has tried to do successfully.Obviously in a production of this kind, the technical aspects are, to put it somehow secondary. The soundtrack is perfectly seated to the tempo of the film, helping to intensify the perceptions of the viewer at any given time.Little more I can say about this film, except that I have been forced to see her by the stubbornness of my sister, who enjoys with the dramones as a small child in a swimming pool. It is the responsibility that I has been so bad taste by the sadness caused by contemplating a tragedy that can happen to anyone. In any case, acceptable as a film.</body>
