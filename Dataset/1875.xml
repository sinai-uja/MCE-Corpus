	<summary>James Foley has traditionally been synonymous with monotony. This film is a perfect example of this.</summary>
	<body>With an argument too simple, more typical of TV movie that desktop, and the only incentive for an important cast, it reaches Spain Seduciendo a stranger, the last film directed by James Foley monotonous. The story revolves around a journalist (starring Halle Berry), who decides to investigate the murder unsolved one of his childhood friends. Via the internet, and with the invaluable collaboration of a hacker (already comes one of series with almost all the films), located in one of the suspects, a billionaire who gives life harmful Bruce Willis, which might be called the man of three faces. Namely: one of joy, one of anger and a third wildcard for the rest of their States of mind.And from here, mess montepío everywhere, messages filled with the classical and hypocritical American moralina and unbridled carousel of topics. Halle Barry, that seems to have regained its lost splendor, is very comfortable in this type of roles, and this is evident in the naturalness that transmits in the interpretation, while Hong Kong the broken and emaciated Giovanni Ribisi, who embodies the hacker that accompanies it, continues to demonstrate that it is one of the players called to set a time. Willis, better not to say anything. Perhaps due to the presence of the first two that the film, with a mediocre screenplay excessively supported in the scenes of sensuality and poor narrative, is no sleeping, and at least serve to entertain. Search any aspirations in it, is wasting time.</body>
