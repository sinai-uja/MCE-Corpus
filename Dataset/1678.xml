	<body>Since its inception, the film has been always linked in a very special way to literature, both classical and contemporary. There are writers especially loved by the film, whose works tend easily to bring to the big screen, in the majority of cases for purely commercial reasons, with the intention of dragging a large number of faithful readers and potential viewers. Almudena Grandes is one of these writers, that five of his novels have been made film versions.Atlas of human geography involves the return of Azucena Rodríguez to cinema after more than ten years of absence, and makes it to face the challenge of adapting the novel by Almudena Grandes. The story focuses on the lives of four women, Anna (Cuca scribe), Fran (Rosa Vila), Rosa (Montse Germán) and Marisa (María Bouzas), and their emotional problems. Though the film begins as a deep exploration of the current women's soul, the plot not takes lead over rough roads, and finally empties into the pure folletín (or soap opera,) as they prefer. The main virtue of the tape is the feeling of verisimilitude and reality that trasnmite, with a few well built and easily recognizable characters for the Viewer, that can be identified. This most notably contribute his Quartet of players, very well directed by Azucena Rodríguez, and made some really excellent performances, and we hope they do not forget them in the face of human geography, despite being a sentimentaloide folletín, Goya.Atlas no longer an acceptable film that can be seen if it has the predisposition of the public. And attention to the winks to Almudena Grandes and Gerardo Herrero with Los Aires difficult, and Joaquín Oristrell unconscious.</body>
