	<summary>Nice but very minor (almost) always genial Charles Chaplin comedy.</summary>
	<body>"During a crossing of importance, an exuberant young is camouflaged as a stowaway in the cabin of an American, not overly honest diplomat".Though the director was a true genius, it's a realization far below their potential. It is not that it is bad, that is nice and has some scenes, especially in the first half, scored in his white comical. What happens is that, IMHO, the script isn't very worked, and the realization is something charisma, if we take into account that the rate decays gradually. However other aspects are achieved: photography, decorations, costume. As regards a couple protagonist, for my taste is out of sync. Both, separately are very good, but on this occasion his Union not gets sparks precisely, proving something cold though which on occasions.Marlon Brando always said that he agreed to participate in the movie without even reading the script. That was its director and creator Charles Chaplin was enough to accept without hesitation. Later was arrepentió, although relations with the genius and Sophia Loren were very cordial.</body>
