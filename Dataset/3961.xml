	<body>Anyone who says that this is better than the wonderful Charlie and the chocolate factory is is wrong. May it seem a clever story with deep message included, but it is nothing more than a rather boring one final hour cuentecillo really endless. So heavy and redundant as its title, Mr. Magorium and his store magic (about redundant comes by its original title, Mr. Magorium Wonder Emporium's), manages that as it progresses (with an unbearable pace) us we away over her and finish feel a void interest. Dustin Hoffman as mad crazy owner of the store is great (probably the most notable of the tape), and his girlfriend Natalie Portman quite correct, although no consigo believe me its role. No doubt, the cast is clearly altered by Jason Bateman, an actor without charisma that only has a good scene in the entire film, and its role is really untapped.It lacks the magic of the film of Burton, fails to be what at first looked like and two or three sequences well carried out and a fun player are not enough. This film what really lacks is a good director, and Zach Helm (stranger than fiction writer of the wonderful) was not the most suitable for this. Continue writing.</body>
