	<body>I dislike the gratuitous violence, and much less in movies that are supposed to be for children. While watching the film comics remembered mentally and if it is true, they are violent, but it is a very innocent violence which rather hints. But when passed the comics to film things change quite. Already happened with Mortadelo y Filem√≥n and it has happened with this. To give an example, the scene in which raining down teeth of Roman Legionary is not something you want that you store in the retina of my toddler.The film is a new visitor arrives to the better-known village of indomitable Gauls. This is the son of a great warrior, so his father entrusts to the villagers, and especially to Asterix and Obelix, make him a man. But the kid is not be what is considered a brave man. WIMP and WIMP will have to pass an ordeal to become a true Gallic Warrior. On the other hand, a tribe of Vikings come to Gaul seeking the secret of flight, who believe to be in fear.The truth is that the film, in the eyes of a somewhat infantiloide adult, is a little roll. The script already know the comics, although they have added you characters and have been mixed concepts of other stories. The plot is easy to follow, clearly delimiting the good and the bad. The drawings are correct and quite passable animation. But I finished not like, given that it is very lacking in the acid humor of Asterix. I personally think that it is too focused on children. But for these, better get the old tapes of Miyazaki, free from violence and evil.In short, to spend an hour with children in the film. Although older possibly is bored a lot.</body>
