	<summary>Tape more than Potter and only remaining 2 to its final, it will please fans, and it horrorizará that have never stopped or even to read the books</summary>
	<body>As I promised, and despite work this week on night shift, and having slept only 3 short hours, as a good fan of Potter and thanks to Muchocine.net and Warner, I came, almost giving me punched in the eyes, to the press of the 5th pass installment of the adventures of the wizard of the scar on his forehead.Say that the film follows the line of the above, I believe that it is the best way to give the kick-off to this, my opinion of the film, however, is far from that for me is the best tape in the series, the only led Alfonso Cuarón, much darker than the rest of the following tapes, whileOnce again, the press has airy that it was darker than the previous ones.It is nothing short of that curious that one of the longer books of J.K. Rowling has been brought to the screen in a tape of only 2: 10 min. duration, the shorter the tape of the "child magician" for the time being, and that the book had quite a few chapters that were little more than "straw" until the final beating.Entering the interpretive chapter, I would say that they are just "bad" &lt;-eye to quotes, which I liked most see Gary Oldman (right that now understand the quotes?) on screen, on the one hand, and by another Helena Bohan Carter as Beatrix Lestrange and Ralph Fienness as "Who should not be named", as well as Imelda StautonIt manages to match the role of Dolores Umbridge of the book.So Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are perfect in the roles that have led them to fame, and it shows the love that have, as you know give in packaging on screen that they require, moreover, Watson suggests ways to become a "face with Angel" and in a few years, if not timeWe will see more than followed on screen it, incidentally Radcliffe it will cost Dios and help remove the role of Potter above, for many works of theatre that makes naked.In terms of special effects!What would this film without them! Note that point to all kinds of CGI graphics animations, are you catching and both the Thestrals, such as Centaurs, transformations of Ninfadora Tonks as well as Grawp the giant brother of Hagrid, based, which gollum in the capture of actor Tony Maudsley movements are quite well made.Nicholas Hooper carried out an excellent work on the soundtrack, with a few touches that equate the tape musically speaking with original score by John Williams, I dare say that we are, with permission of the Williams, one of the best scores of the saga of Potter.En definite, a tape of Potter and only remain 2 to its finalIt will please fans and horrorizará who have never stopped or even to read the books.</body>
