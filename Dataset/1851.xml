	<body>Batman is so called since that gave fear of bats and decides to confront their fears. That game it give this! Imagine they had given fear traffic lights, chickens, cockroaches or Strawberry calipos. That little imagination had the creators of this character (but that good vision commercial, given that CalipoMan had not taken both pull, sure).The film is, as its name suggests, the beginning of Batman. When I was a child, his father was a wealthy altruistic (already starting science fiction) that gives everything for their city. One day, this rewards you killing him and his wife, so Batman decides to travel the world in vigilante plan. In a prison close to where Moses gave the three voices, is reconducido by a man that she wants to get into a kind of sect dedicated to clean up the world of criminals. After adriestarle, pass loads of things that I am not telling you.In this movie they spend such amount of stuff, worth long that is. It has nothing to do with the above, we do not have a bad more silly than a sweet potato, for example. The bad guys are bad and rightly so, but bad really, anything from nonsense. The argument quickly latches and the story is nice. Secondary actors are good and very well give the pego. And the special effects are not too exaggerated and Yes very correct. He end is what seemed more silly and absurd, but you can go because the set is very good.In short, popcorn and sofa. I recommend it.Besis.P.D: Nothing it if they had given him fear the Rails (if not I say bust and full of guts all).Pd2: Pollaman, heh, heh.P.D.3: that day more tonto, really;-)</body>
