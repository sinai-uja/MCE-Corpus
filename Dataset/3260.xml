	<body>Second test of madurezImaginemos to the Superbad boys a few years later. Each has pursued its path and more or less survive as they can, even if it is on the basis of compensation. After overcoming (I already say, more or less) the difficulties of adult life and try to feel proud for something other than smoking with colleagues and see naked in movies to compile them in a web doomed to failure, see where you discover one that can still climb a little more in this "do more, be respected and take pride in the family". I is I think, at the moment, as the Portas of the film at the beginning (what the hell, I still think as the Superbad) and why I think almost touching the approach that Apatow gives his new movie, in which a fumeta becomes the great mistake of a mujerón with clear things in life and in principle, without room for such freak.The rest of (so excessively long as endearing) footage is the opportunity it gives you to him and vice versa.Full of side spectacular (while Paul Ruud makes time that is a reality) has everything what is usual in the new USA comedy with three gags of the best of the year, delicious band sound and as for "the first part" (and I am referring to Superbad), an honesty that I laugh of Dr. House maybe the incredible thing is that that girl bundle with that boy, but if the stars are where they need to be and it's crazy celebrations overnight and one abused his single step of dance, hell, can occur. That is why it is a movie and why is a comedy.A wonderful and touching comedy.</body>
