	<body>What more expressive, while sinister poster.The film is the life of two kids in the vicinity of the age of majority in Bilbao. These, one son of a guardia civil and the other a member of abertxale, get into the heroine a bad day and need to steal and smuggle to continue their addiction.That tougher film, my mother. From my point of view, what is notable about the tape is the way so crude to treat two very topical issues in the early 1980s in Spain. On the one hand, the heroine that ravaged this generation, doing away entire groups of friends. On the other hand, the problem of the independence of the Basque country, which reached its highest level of violence by those dates. The development can be done something heavy, especially the younger players are not too good (I was surprised very negative bad serving the young Henry San Francisco). But the overall vision of the film, seen more as that documentary as film itself, offset more than this little problem.In short, tough film must see if you want to know pieces of history Spain contemporanea. I note that people scenes leave by injecting into the vein that may be violent on the raw and natural appearing.ImprescindibleBesitos.P.D: The scene of the baby pacifier puts hairs as hooks.Pd2: The end I liked a lot, Tad cakes, but what the hell, is not going to be all pain and suffering, a bit of compassion with the Viewer.P.D.3: From the movie the Lord of the rings I guess that the name of Urko will have fallen into oblivion, is not it? I had to make a joke, this has been more sad than the day died Chanquete.</body>
