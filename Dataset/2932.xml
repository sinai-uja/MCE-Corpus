	<body>Finally, the two segments of Grindhouse premiere in our country (and most of Europe) separated. Although appreciated the Grindhouse stamp on the posters by Aurum, sorry, it is not the same but at least I I can not think that the Weinstein brothers have come away with: cheating Europeans by dividing the product invented by Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino, and earn twice to paste in the English-speaking territories. A business round.Finally, the last, is past, and now get to see these two tributes from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino to the cheap and crappy B-movies, and Z, Planet Terror and Death Proof.Yo and saw Planet Terror and I had a fairly well. As I am not an expert in the Filmography of Rodriguez, I can not say or compare much, but Planet Terror is not bad. It is a full of guts surprisingly digestible, quite fun and enjoyable, thug with a very acceptable rate, and great sense of humor. It is both times to exceed the fine line that separates a film Disney and fun, a Scary Movie laughing glib and child.But good. There are creates Rodriguez a micro universe quite funny, peculiar and bizarre, that I am not surprised nothing to the bud of Texas (which I like very well, despite Spy Kids and other chungueces that has come to shoot) would like to revisit.Not recommended for those who take too seriously the film.</body>
