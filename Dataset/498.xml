	<body>Matt Saunders is a normal boy who one day meets the scruffy and shy Jenny Johnson. They will begin to leave and she is madly fall of he in love, but what Saunders unknown is that Jenny is actually G-Girl, a famous superheroine with superpowers as strength, speed, etc. When Jenny becomes possessive and jealous he decides to leave the relationship, is when to start their problems.We have here a typical comedieta romance cake and such, but clear, the head is Ivan Reitman, a specialist in fantastic comedies, and the protagonist is a superheroine, so if we together in the cocktail shaker all that the result is a comedy quite geek and fun that it will make us have fun.Uma Thurman in her role as G-Girl serves as a female Superman, that his powers are virtually identical, and the supervillain is a wealthy entrepreneur, which directly leads us to think in a Lex Luthor.La film has points really hilarious and past thread, such as the scene of the shark, a very witty dialogues especially by the friend of the protagonista kind of geek that the waitress at the bar gives pumpkins throughout the day and that is the most sympathetic of the film.There is something I do not understand the majority of American comedies and this stupid habit of finishing in the last scene solving the problems in front of a bunch of strangers, who have always just admired and applauding. But good by removing a few topics the film can be seen and it is fun and is also the most geek, provides also the terms little Treaty of superheroinas, when you are going to save the world and man stays waiting.</body>
