	<body>He said week on Monster House it was a movie as before, fun and emotional, that would be a piece of our hearts forever. Clerks already occupied and I dare say that, more than the movie itself, what we remember fondly is, in general, the universe Smith. Because well, Clerks II has nothing to envy to the best work of the Jersey, with permission of chasing Amy.Clerks II works perfectly without being explicit sequel, almost, is a tribute to these two subsidiaries of life we are all without being the cartoon (fun, but cartoon) it was Jay and silent Bob Bob.The characters continue to operate as they did little more than one decade ago and now also have a lot of things to talk about (because this is a movie for people who speak.) (If Randal hear me I'm dead man), although in general, speak of the same: sex, freaks and film Trilogies. And of course that there are cameo appearances. And of course it is fun. In fact, the very bastard bearded has me excited at times, note that if that becomes greater (without falling into the fussiness) boot, with transition from black and white to the included color, great. Kevin is still alive. 8. (and no, I have not seen Jersey girl)</body>
