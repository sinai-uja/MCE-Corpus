	<summary>Without order or concert, Scary Movie 4 is the worst that has been released in our country since the beginning of the year</summary>
	<body>David Zucker is one of those directors who were marked by some degrees of success in the Decade of the eighties (lands as you can, catch it as you can). Determined to continue on the path of comedy, his career is has been diluted and deteriorating to offer us a hodgepodge of the calibre of which today opens in Spain. Scary Movie 4 is not or if you want a movie, is just a succession of parodies of other tapes as "The forest", "The war of the worlds", "The grudge", "Million dollar baby" and more. Degenerate, uncouth, vulgar, humor full of histrionics and exempt of originality is its only claim. Its cast is filled with sleepless actors and scarce talent, like Anna Faris, Regina may and the infumable Leslie Nielsen; You can others like Shaquille O´Neal or Carmen Electra not even them be called actors. The so-called teen horror has always been the source from which these films have drunk ridicule them and vampirizan to create grotesque situations from the original scenes. Without order or concert, Scary Movie 4 is the worst that has been released in our country since the beginning of the year, and another insult to the intelligence of the Viewer. It is a mamarracho of dimensions magnérrimas and while some smile starts at the beginning, as they pass the minutes becomes unbearable and boring. The only incentive to see this aberration, that does not serve or to pass the time (its eighty-six minutes look like ten hours), is the move awhile rooms air conditioning cold, or in the company of friends, to laugh and not with the film.
