	<body>Brett Ratner, like Brian Singer, has read the comic book series X-Men, but it is more than likely that you also enjoyed, have molado you and has thrilled with them. Ratner does not need to seek nothing more bullets than there are drawn, but is unable to get them everything the party needed, because it is obvious that as little is much worst director to Brian Singer.Puede thank that major virtue of X-Men 3, the final decision is that when it starts already is started: Singer endowed to the history of more ambitious readings and at least moderately intelligent, which at the same time sought some dramatic load characters. Ratner, perhaps incapable of both, directly enters the action after a brief prologue (as bright as necessary) to develop which paradoxically is the best argument of the three, but also the most untapped step. The vision of Ratner on X-Men is summarized in this time there are many more mutants (too many) but we imported some menosX Men 3 offers confusion and chaos to develop all its narrative plots, but the legacy of its two predecessors is still powerful, even intermittently the final decision is allowed some potentísimos moments, in fact the best of the trilogy, as it is the succession of their three big climax: the kiss between Jane and Cyclops, the duel telequinético, or the lifting of the Brooklyn Bridge, even if on the contrary the end runs, in comparison, something loose. X Men-3 closes the series with a furious and unbridled vision but equally or more entertaining, as well as continue to allow other interpretations more serious, which for the moment at least I do not have too many wanted to find.</body>
