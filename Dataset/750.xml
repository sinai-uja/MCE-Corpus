	<body>Normally, sagas are decreasing in quality as they advance the aftermath. There is precedent for excellent titles, such as the Exorcist, which was degenerating from excellence to ridicule. On the other hand are those second and third parties in which not reflected a difference in quality as large by the simple fact of being grotesque aberrations from the beginning. There are so many examples that I come to my mind that I'll better shut up because if not the limited space available to me would become totally inadequate. Saw is located halfway between the two tracks that I have described, because it has never been a masterpiece but also a pigswill. For those who do not know what is the thing, tell them that the film tells the story of a sadistic murderer butcher of wholesale food market-minded. As usual, the script is repetitive with respect to its predecessors, and the lack of new ideas is masked by increasing the amounts of blood and the volume of the speakers. Saw III is quite closer to gender gore that his first two deliveries, but still has something that makes it entertaining. In my case, I guess I had fun these films because they seem absurd and often cause me a contrary to the intended effect, but what are you going to do. That Yes, Tobin Bell has a face of bad bug (doesn't roles rather than dark characters) that is worth the trouble to see it. On the other hand, if what you seek is something bleak and gloomy, I recommend they see the journal of Patricia or any program of these, surely that outweigh, twisted plot of any film of this genre. And they are also free.</body>
