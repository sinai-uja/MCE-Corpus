	<body>I can still hear the laughter of David Lynch behind the screen. Very bastard managed to have me three hours sitting in the Chair watching. something.I would like to start warning of all the movies of Lynch, unless A true story, afraid me. This is the synopsis official, attention: the history of a mystery. The history of a mystery in a world within other worlds that are revealed about a woman. A woman in love and in trouble. J치 J치 J치Inland Empire is an autohomenaje that provides the nutty Lynch (official, is crazy) and his time, bridging the gap were Kevin Smith in Jay and silent Bob Bob or Carpenter in ghosts of Mars. And if you don't believe me look at the end credits. Inland Empire is a story of actresses, whores and a family of rabbits who lives between canned laughter. And terror, because Inland Empire is a horror movie.Expressionist ratos, videoclipera, always different moments (and digital), you need the absolute surrender of the Viewer from the first moment to not check out by legs at the half-hour. It could also be the incomplete pilot of a new mystery series cancelled before finishing the filming.Or could also be a revision lynchiana of the "mythical" La fin absolue du monde, not you fuck.I do that I know. I like it. I hate it. Put your note when you see. But go to see her.</body>
