	<body>One of the best Spanish filmmakers which soon premiered Oviedo Express has several rarities to rediscover in his filmography.In the 1970s he went twice to the popular pair of singers in the aforementioned morbid for the following year return to work in the film adventures to the Devil with love.A year later he insists on terror with the she-Wolf and la paloma where gathering an impossible partner, the protagonist of the saga HALOOWEEN "DONALD PLEASENCE" and neighborhood film presenter Carmen Seville. Centándronos in what we are discussing the author get at all times a rarefied atmosphere that transmits unrest from beginning to end. With similarities to the last House on the left of that same year. Especially because of its explosive final part where the violence makes an appearance with rape and torture filmed very similarly to the documentary.Ana Belén shows his good artistic skills not in vain is a respectable filmography with titles of some success in the Turkish or libertarian passion. Her husband plays perfectly to a shocking Maria Vico that lead shortly after the bloody ceremony cast.The film is dense and slow immerses us in a pesadillesca narrative in one of these really refreshing rarities of the Spanish film.
