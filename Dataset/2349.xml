	<body>The Cannes Festival awarded the prize of the international critics to this tape in 2006 and now glides on our bulletin board. "Climates" tells the story of a couple love and although the approach can be simple, this story hides others, as in life itself.The really interesting thing, at least for me, to see other cinemas (in this case is a Turkish film in co-production with France) is to discover other ways to count, other ways of seeing the reality that surrounds us and soak it in the film at 24 frames per second. In this case Nuri Bilge opts for a slow pace, long flat sequence without having to move the camera and compositions seeking to sow in the viewer a thing beyond what it is telling. It may seem that happens much in the film, but on the inside of the characters is happening a lot. It is often more important to mention that what you have.In around 100 planes (a film of the same length usually have almost three times more quantity of planes) director Nuri Bilge, relying on the strictest technical simplicity, perversely delves into the souls of the characters he portrays with his camera, to discover the psychological complexity human and discover that the reasons that cause us happiness and unhappiness are always the simplest.I would recommend this film to all lovers of the cinema, which will not give them fear trying new things and enjoy life at a leisurely pace, who are observers of their environment and the human condition. However those who enjoy speed, aesthetics and the rhythm music video, should refrain from seeing this movie, because they are not going to tune with the slow Cadence which from the outset prints the Director the film.</body>
