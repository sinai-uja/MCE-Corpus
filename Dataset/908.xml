	<body>It can be summarized in a line: Sun does at the beginning and at the end it rains. The visual style evokes nostalgia, but the beauty remains on a skin. Chicos guapos with little clothing sunbathing girls swimming in the pool or dancing in the rain. But here everything stays in effect, topic and not beyond. If you want a movie with a visual style at the same time refined fresh is better watch "You, me and everyone we know," the film of last year of Miranda July.El "Camino de los ingleses" protagonist is a boy who tells us many times that he wants to be a poet, but not seen in him no indication of passionate blood. The characters here more than talk launch in jerks pedagogical monologues. All very symbolic and very hurry to be literary. He ends up staying in the air, and fails to say anything.Even the symbols with which aims to break the narrative line are topical: a dancer, who will serve your guts in a tray and the scene of the end (do not think that you unveil anything) the boy barefoot across the zebra crossing. Is it that he became one of the Beatles? Therefore, no he deserves it.When appears Victoria Abril is a great pleasure, and up you permeates sweetness and a drop of complexity to his character of last years typing teacher that it plays of seductive. But I am not sure that ends out of the cartoon.Everything is very hyperbolic, hyperbolic, too hyperbolic. Oh, and repetitive. It is excessively literary not to say anything. Now, if make merchandising design objects that appear in the film: clothing, glasses, machine, writing, pianos and desks; I buy everything. Much visual work which unfortunately remains empty.</body>
