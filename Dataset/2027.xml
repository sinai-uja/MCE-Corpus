	<body>"During a stormy night, a few bandits kill an entire family, except for the youngest son, of ten years;" "it shall be fixed in the image of the bandits, and years later, would seek them to take revenge, with the help of a man betrayed by those and also wants revenge."This spaghetti western is not that it differs very much from the rest of the rest, but the address, carried out by Giulio Petroni, is more fortunate than the average in this type of product. As well and all, to the principle becomes a tad heavy, with scenes filled with nothing, bland and somewhat puzzling. Not sure if it will be a hodgepodge, an example of pedantry, or maybe lead into something positive. And, thank God, this happens last, with final third that is the best of the film, getting interest really in the violent confrontation between beings despiados, lacking at that time of any shred of humanity. A film too irregular, that has good scenes and denotes know to be behind the cameras. Unfortunately the pace is not appropriate and the script gives quite fits.</body>
