	<body>I suddenly thought that KUBRICK resucitaba to rescue the film with his usual bombast. Minutes after I realized that I have too much imagination because the director is none other than the idolized magnolia PAUL THOMAS ANDERSON author possessed by the spirit of the unforgettable Director of Clockwork Orange.Wells of ambition breathes classicism on all four sides with all the features that will make it a magnum opus with the passage of time an essential title which shows that from time to time the film if it is an art.A REMAKE of giant last of revolutions with the impressive DANIEL DAY LEWIS returning after one of its periods of silence after GANGS OF NEW YORK, occasionally seemed to me see on screen very MARLON BRANDO as the British shell composed one of these characters with the bowels that eats the camera with the force of a freight train.A work mastodontica from the portrait of characters driven by greed, corruption and lack of ethics where you walk into a destructive Dynamics where dementia takes over all the characters in a descent into hell that takes you to the end little Orthodox but truly terrifying.A somewhat austere photography although it reflects perfectly the arid landscapes, nothing you is this huge work which draws one of the darkest and most terrible of the human condition canvases.Obviously it is not film for all ages must recognize you a dense work but if you go on it you can not leave.</body>
