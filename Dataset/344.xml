	<body>We see that, we see that, he told me the awareness. For desintoxiacar the brain of mega American productions with shots, explosions and other action. And at what point did case to the brain, when theirs is to leave it on the nightstand before going to the cinema. In the end.The film is a girl that has a role where it says take one at random. Total, gets involved in a high-speed train and choose one with stupid face, quickly believed that it has been linked. This makes it to dupe those who persecute Anthony Zimmer (a famous international fraudster) that he is the and thus to kill him and that the true escape of scot-free. But as the film progresses, the face of silly is that it zafa with more or less wit, with more or less help, and falls for which tricked him at the beginning. And at the end is the big surprise unsurprising to anyone (except for the House in which takes place).This is a fart in all its splendor. The story they tell us is quite absurd, based on continuous coincidences. I was not hooked in no time to the car, and that the plot is very lentita. Then the things that makes the protagonist make me very nervous, touching the absolute tontez. We am not intrigued in no time, the thing is very predictable and once completed you realize that all is absurd (if you see it, consider whether the situations they fit or everything is fruit of the most extreme coincidence).To sum up, roll without plot interest, with characters that do not end attract and a story so far we fail or happens to us to glimpse her.</body>
