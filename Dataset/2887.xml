	<summary>A modern classic not aging at all.</summary>
	<body>Taking advantage, not only my wedding anniversary, but the cosmopolitan channel has returned to replace some modern "classics", I encountered, again, this jewel of the current film, and, I had forgotten is magnificent is the tape of Bill Murray, Andie MacDowell, Chris Elliott, led by the always brilliant Harold Ramis, is also true that at times it can grate the recurrence of situationsgiven that Murray and we all relived again and again the same day, though, also that grated note his attractive touch, and the evolution of the life of this over and over again.Highlights as well as Murray (who was going to say to this man that Sofia Coppola was going to rediscover as "serious actor") Andie MacDowell at the time which was one of the beautiful faces of cinema (now a past to be typical of independent cinema), and Chris Elliot, in his time of highly topical for the series "Get life".The only downside I see is that someone not between "the game" of the same, and the repetition of situations seem a sovereign stupidity can occur, but is not typical, and Murray in elgunos time is too sobreactuado, but well, also sobreactuan others and are famous throughout the world.There is a real freak towards the film, with an official website about the famous Groundhog Phil and where resolve us doubts about it, by the way, the Groundhog Day is February 2, if anyone was curious.</body>
