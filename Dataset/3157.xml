	<summary>A crappy show that again will raise a good jug of $ on DVD and will refresh the ailing economy of the House of mouse Mickey, who not lift head, except for tontunas like these, or brilliant "daughter" Pixar movies.</summary>
	<body>The first part of this Disney film that not only collection (DVD, that we are talking about a television tape), us $ and also sold anything from merchandising that pulled the market with the nombrecito "High School.", I thought it was a sovereign stupidity, but, as Disney has seen the goose that lays the golden egg by in this comedy teen teen, and since my wife is a fan of this type of film, the second installment had to see it (would like to or not).Again, and as I said at the time, we we have a laughable show that, disguised as a clumsy musical, puts the kids (cut by the same patron) in this farce of "popularity" and stupidity made in USA.Clear of facile songs, the insistent rhythm, and the loving crap of the actors on screen, do the rest, honestly, I think it is a crappy show that again will raise a good jug of $ on DVD and will refresh the ailing economy of the House of mouse Mickey, who not lift head, except for tontunas like these or great movies of her "daughter" Pixar. SÃ© to adolescents, fans of the series in the world, not only will remember of me, and my entire family, deeming me snob, asshole and other stories, eye, not I blame them, but to know that there are 100,000 better than this, and best musical Bill.And see the song of the first delivery, that of "We're soaring, flying." seems to me a beautiful theme.</body>
