	<summary>A tape essential see, fans of the characters of Matt Groening, both of which they are not and one purchase more than insured on DVD.</summary>
	<body>One of the summer films expected with more desire and, a priori, one of which gave me more fear, and is that, I wasn't entirely convinced that after 400 episodes (that is said soon but they encompass 20 years of series), the film could preserve the freshness, the interest and humor, the series which had for so long, so that one bought the entry fearing that, under the wrapper of the Simpsons, we encontraramos with some tiny quality y.No has been so, the film from beginning to end is a bright reinvention of the series and a continuation of what we have seen for so long on the small screen, able to maintain not only the interest from beginning to end, but that there are also plenty of winks towards the fans more geeks series.And it is, from the cameos, from Tom Hanks to Arnold Schwarzennegger, passing by Greenday or Hillary Clinton, all, again, have room in the film, adding to the characters we already know.Ah! a note, Fox made running the rumor, of everything that appeared in the trailer had nothing to do with the movie, sadly is not so.On the other hand, I foresee that FOX has been a Philo to explode the yellow characters, and can (perhaps can) that within a year or even 2 are again in the cinema watching the new adventures of Homer, Lisa, Bart, Marge and Maggie.Resumiendo, a tape must see for fans of the characters of Matt Groening, which they are not and one purchase more than guaranteed (at least on my part) on DVD.</body>
