	<summary>Turn a bland employee into a walking time bomb, leading him through situations halfway between the Tarantiniano humor and four yellow humor.</summary>
	<body>'Monday' (2000), of the Japanese director Hiroyuki Tanaka (better known as Sabu (?)) premiered at last in this our third world culture endorsed by the FIPRESCI award of the Berlin film festival of that year (in which reaped up to three awards) and comparisons with the splendid ' After hours' of Martin Scorsese. Man, no I said that does not have nearly the same amount of scenes in a bar than the small classic of Marty, but apart from that, the comparisons are odious pulling. Come on, it is not so much for the film in question.The argument is simple: Takagi wakes up in a hotel room that is his only guest, without knowing why. He does not remember anything of the last hours. In fact, not remember anything since that he attended a surreal funeral, which starred involuntary. Since that hazy memory, Takagi begins to remember the weekend that changed his life forever, because of an explosive mixture of alcohol, weapons and Japanese lounge music.The surprise factor is the best weapon of Sabu in 'Monday': a bland employee becomes a walking time bomb, leading him through situations halfway between humour Tarantiniano (specific references to 'Pulp Fiction' are obvious) and four yellow humor. Also has a couple of really fun scenes, and proves to be a good creator of images (the time of dance is the brightest of the film). But the second half of the film is dominated by predictability, once we know where we want to take the good of Sabu. And to make matters worse, this is one of those movies with multifinal, quite arbitrary, by the way, what definitely deflated a sympathetic but too irregular proposal.5. Not bored, but nor is the PEAR.</body>
