	<body>You thought that he had died? Yes, of course, all we had done, but when they do the autopsy to Jigsaw has left one of its cryptic text messages in his stomach for the sake of saving humanity from themselves. In this last installment (which surely will be preceded by more Roman numerals very soon) we find another orchestrated series of bloody evidence and gores and a bit of history pre-asesinatos in which we meet the protagonist after the clown of the first three deliveries before their final goodbye.Saw IV attempts to offer a bit more of the same. There is not much new, is a species of huge Deja vu that not only adds nothing new if not that is plagiarism itself (namely its predecessor Saw III) and fails to appeal to the novice or reconquer the viewer of their first deliveries. We recognize that a part of a good lover of horror movies with its first part thought that I could finally find a reference in the current film release at any talk of the genre, but seeing as the saga unfolded it is better to forget all the other tapes that have caricatured the good idea of the first to turn it into a joke of if same. If in the third you felt the same sense of pathological boredom I felt it is better that you effectively taches memory the existence of Saw IV and let things as they were, if on the contrary you enjoy with the pointless gore and you no matter the obvious end from the beginning. Go ahead! All yours.</body>
