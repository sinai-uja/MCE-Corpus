	<body>In the 1970s a man named Frank Lucas became one of the biggest gangsters dealing with drug that brought directly from Viet Nam, the film account the real history of this gangster and detective who captured him.Ridley Scott has directed this film about a black mobster of the 1970s in New York City, the quality of the film is very high in terms of forms, and that is the problem, which is perhaps too "formal", follows the rules of the genre to strictly and not leaves nothing to innovation.The interpretations are perfect, both Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington are perfectly their roles. The character played by Denzel Washington is a mobster who with his family is loving, polite, correct and however is able to kill with one shot point-blank in the street in broad daylight the day a person; the other protagonist is the police played by Russell Crowe, who also has a "double life" by calling it somehow, because in his work is the most honest of all and yet his personal life is nothing short of disastrous. This duality of the characters is very well worn in the film.The film can accuse you of it has a principle very slow and too fast end, something that some will like it and others not, as is my case. I would have liked that the relationship between the police and the gangster is caught when the end it had developed more, however is resolved with four strokes which lead us directly to the end.American Gangster is an interesting film and it has quality, however, leaves the feeling of that could have been much better if Ridley Scott had not conformed with the formal quality and would have gone a little further.</body>
