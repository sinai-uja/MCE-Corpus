	<summary>The film is pretty good, but fails to translate 100% one of the longer books and more "breadcrumbs" the Potter saga.</summary>
	<body>Chris Columbus contributed to the first two deliveries of "Harry Potter" a magical aura, of children's books (could not be for less, as they were the first two books so), then came Alfonso Cuar√≥n and transformed the Potter saga into a dark and littered with tape of chiaroscuro, however Mike Newell transforms series into a mere romantic comedieta (could not be for less)(British director is the "author" of films such as "4 weddings and a funeral" or "Mona Lisa Smile").I can not deny that the film I liked enough, that delude ourselves, and however, I expected something more, a great book that they have failed to capture even half, eat things that will be important and try to put to shoehorn some meat of the fifth book (also fifth film), the interpreters, as always, to the trio protagonist because it shows them comfortable in their respective roles and such timeIt should be focus attention to beginners but do quite well are not at the height of their co-stars.Two of the film, are undoubtedly, Brendan Gleeson ("finding Moody") and Ralph Fiennes ("as Voldemort") although perhaps this last I could you imagine rather more dangerous as they show us on screen.In short; the film is pretty good, but fails to translate 100% one of the longer books and more "breadcrumbs" the saga of Potter, I recommend not going with all hopes for the film or the disappointment could be enormous.</body>
