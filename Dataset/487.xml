	<body>The best American comedy is born on SNL (Satrday Night Live) is a fact. SNL is what here LHC (La Hora Chanante), only that takes twenty years on the air. For a long time C + (Canal plus) aired, the last Saturday of the month a SNL. Since John Belushi to Jack Black, Bill Murray and Chevy Chase, everyone, without exception, have left the show.In "Virgin at 40" ownership rests with Steve Carell, which achieves a tender portrait with his Andy Stizer, this beloved Virgin of Jewish traits with some friends who wanted already to many. With coarse salt and at times not so fat is easily linking a number of laughter. The only downside is the duration, a comedy of 128 minutes is impossible, although waiting is reward with a few apotheosis end credits.A phrase: "I have nothing against the fags, I have friends who fucked them." "In prison". 8.</body>
