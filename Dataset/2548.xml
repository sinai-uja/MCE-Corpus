	<summary>Ruby &amp; Quentin. They are the highlights of the film by its good chemistry together, but there really is much more to highlight.</summary>
	<body>Here is all very French. Director, actors, location, aires. Action comedy with the also French times, light years from the tax model Yankee for good and for evil.But this stereotype or cliché, also tells us everything you need to know. Francis Veber made your little pretentious and always friendly address with its characteristics of simplicity of script, mounting and thickness in general.Similar to his previous although less accomplishments effective - dinner of the fools, the closet - where everything runs without problem but with perhaps little emotion. Full of gags, as smart as slow, resembling the character performs Gérard Depardieu - Ruby-in a convincing performance and with the interpretative variety which we are accustomed in his choice of roles. Cannot be said the same of Jean Reno, which while is not bad seems trapped by the character of cold and lethal killer who made it famous in the perfect killer (Luc Besson, 1994), called lion and that still lurking it in all implementation to date with some slight variation (remember Ronin, Godzilla, etc). Also they are the highlights of the film by its good chemistry together, but there really is much more to highlight. To finish and if I may, here is the last common place: light, enjoyable entertainment. and forgettable in hours.</body>
