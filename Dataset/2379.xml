	<summary>The tape leaves the first part as something amazing (which it was) and this into something that could be and that wasn't... disappointed.</summary>
	<body>A priori, a weekly tapes that interested me the most and one of the summer that more desire had to sink the teeth, once seen my opinion may not be more unfavourable, and is that perhaps, moved or motivated by a longing and hope to be a sequel to almost as excellent as its predecessorthe direction of Juan Carlos Fresnadillo stays sosa, is lost in a thousand stories that we have seen in hundreds of times in this genus (zombies, gore, as you want to call it) and finally it ends up being empty and dull.To begin with, there are 2 things that have bothered me greatly (3 would be good but one of them I am sure they have no fault.), the first heavy and loud music that accompanies much of the footage is A melodic composition was not well, or that? On the other hand in most action scenes the camera moves so quickly that it is impossible to appreciate nothing, giving here and there, stumbled over and over again, the third is almost unbearable cold makes in the cinema in summer and which obliges me to enter always projection loaded with a sweatshirt, that given the summer temperatures it sounds like more dementia than something that can be done with clarity, ah! and that is the projection has fucked 2 times, but well, that's a bad lower right?I have to say that when I watched the movie images and I found the small Mackintosh Muggleton, sheathed in the shirt of the team of my loves, I felt a chill and said, for the first time Real Madrid not get in a film jam by Florentino.En end, I don't extend too, the tape leaves the first part as something amazing (which it was) and this into something that could be and that it was not. He was disappointed.</body>
