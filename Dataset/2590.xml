	<body>It was perhaps the 2 tape that compose the film that most interest me produced, and is that the image of Rose McGowan (the already mythical Paige Matthews of "Charmed") with a machine gun instead of one of his legs, and I woke up some morbid fascination and curiosity.Say that in "Grindhouse" is taken care of everything from their non-existent trailers to the blurred image of the celluloid, everything smells like that ro√±oso film of continuous session that many have enjoyed in our childhood, this double programme where it was possible to mix any film and view from the afternoon until the evening, reenganchando with what he had not been able to see.Rodriguez made up a debtor partly from his previous work film (I am referring to the excellent "Sin City" where the cameo appearances occur everywhere, and it is that the appearances of Bruce Willis as well as Tarantino (the other architect of this tape), an extraordinary precedent in a movie, cumbersome/scurfy which deserves the penalty not be forgotten; by the way), before that I forget, can also enjoy, even if only in a couple of scenes from the presence of Stacy Ferguson, singer of the "Black Eyes Peas", giving life to a "jamona" appearing on the tape.The author of "El Mariachi" (among others), filled with the gore tape uncut is, indeed at times is more comic than tragic, or disgusting as the offal appears over and over again on screen, without the minor hint of concern towards the audience to jelly and is pleased with the destripada meat appearing everywhere.Apart from Rose McGowan, will certainly not happen to the annals of cinema with his interpretation, but if with his physique, notably Freddy Rodriguez, with his character of Wray, a hero of action, of yore, the style of Van Damme, Stallone and company.Particularly worrying is the role of Marley Shelton, with a face of horror/terror during much of the footage, and that the presence of the camera just Rodriguez with her large blue eyes comes as ring to the finger.Something that we will lose in Spain, by the way, is the lack of rolls (which here is obvious, ridiculous and even funny) annul the possibility to follow the argument so that one has to imagine (or believe) that tell us, without having seen previously.Simply great, brilliantly simple.</body>
