	<summary>One more argument for those who think that second parts were never good. It is very bad, but honestly bad. Without subterfuge.</summary>
	<body>Although that second parts were never good sounds like a topic and there are many continuations better than its predecessors, the truth is that generally do usually have a decline in quality as the sagas accumulate titles.The return of the damned meets this maxim to letter, and if we take into account that the film that comes, the hills have eyes, is of itself a crappy, because you can already imagine the magnitude of the offense to the seventh art that involves this aberration. The truth is that little more could be expected of Wes Craven, outdated and repeated endlessly, with a monumental creative resources shortage and an obsession with death bloody and viscous that clears the psychotic. In this case, the punishment begins with an expedition of members of the U.S. National Guard, heading to make a delivery of material to a New Mexico research camp. When they arrive, they find that there is not a soul there, but to go to search for them on the hills that surround, they start out mutants man-eaters. That is all. The distribution, as it is normally the case in these wastes, is a group of semidesconocidos (anyone who has a minimum of prestige would star in such nonsense). In any case, we must be clear that films of this subgenre are basically aimed at a teenage audience that seeks only to spend a fun with friends while on the Saturday evening. Why it must be said in his defence that is produced without pretensions, that it does not try to pretend it is not nor falls into the temptation of moralistic message. It is very bad, but honestly bad. Without subterfuge.</body>
