	<body>Something is wrong in Hollywood is not news. Refers to crisis of ideas. There is more to stop to see what kinds of products we are getting from the homeland of MacDonalds: remakes, third, fourth, fifths of resorting to adapt stories is assumed in advance will have a public faithful (e.g. of the comics), films insubstantial and with many special effects, in short, are these days are flooding our billboards.Now it is the turn to Shrek the third. It is not a peliculón and nor is fun as it was the first part (in fact are lucky if it can boot you a single laugh). It is simply a product most of the exhausted "factory of dreams California", a product to consume fast and then forget.The history fails to hook. In this case Shrek goes in search of the new King of "Far far away" while "Prince Charming" plans to overthrow him and invest himself King. And sometime, than presences with eyes as dishes, the story becomes the typical comedy of yankee Institute. The interpretations are correct and in accordance with what is expected of them. If at the end you are going to dare to drop you by the cinema to see it I recommend that at least the see in original. Now, do not say that were not warned!</body>
