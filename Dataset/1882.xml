	<body>There are two film genres that usually me entertain with ease. The children's animation movies and science fiction. The last of the director of Trainspotting, the beach or 28 days later is the story of a space mission in the not too distant future where the Sun is dying and they explode a bomb to create a new star from the great Astro.Muchas times an absurd argument can give as a result a great movie. But this is not the case.To see it, made the mistake of trust of the commentary of the critic of the cadena SER, Theophilus the Necrophiliac film program: is closer to "2001" to "War of the galaxies" and has also elements of "Alien". It raises more than just special effects. If look like 2001 is has a central computer which also speak with the voice, pass, but otherwise he fails or at the bottom of the shoes. The dialogues are simple. So explain you everything what you are doing as if you were stupid, but then (due to a bad montage) do not you learn if they have already reached a site or location who at every moment. On 4 occasions they are deciding the lives of the crew with things as there is only a suit and must die, or there is no oxygen for so many and not to be sacrificed.Even the last quarter, with the introduction of one element or less surprising, just back the flight of a movie that not kept me interested except for some poetic attempt with the Sun as the protagonist.The best, the snoring from someone from the seat back that seemed to form part of the sound effects of the spacesuits.
