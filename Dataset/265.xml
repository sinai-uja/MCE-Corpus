	<summary>Desert, loaded guns and so exaggerated duels as, fortunately, free wild</summary>
	<body>The children of America are, in any case, the protagonists of the hills have eyes; no longer by the family of mutants to survive in the desert, whose importance is deliberately diluted in the Aja remake; but rather on the other, the middle class, who crosses the same desert for very different reasons is that really seems to be of interest to the French filmmaker, and is that perhaps the version 2006 of the Wes Craven classic evolves for revenge cannibalism to spaghetti-western; with what this entails: desert, loaded guns and so exaggerated duels as, fortunately, free wild.AJA spits blood in a western in which the protagonists are ordinary people, like us, have built their progress on the indifference towards others; at least until that are assaulted in a claustrophobic space opened by the deformed face of horror: our fear of the (a) normal. Terror is masterfully summarized in the frame of a corpse estacada for the American flag, it defended the proud Democrats doing the tape, nodding but that Yes, not hesitate to take the retrograde Republican lead inside at the precise moment that feel that they have to make sure, whatever the case, the survival of their own; including cruelty. Well looked, perhaps not so different from those mutants.</body>
