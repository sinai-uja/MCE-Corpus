	<summary>Balanced combination of social reporting and commercial cinema, following the fashion of the film complaint that benefits billionaires.</summary>
	<body>By combining the adventure with the documentary and social reporting, and of course with profit, comes to our screens blood diamond, starring Leonardo DiCaprio in constant search of himself, Djimon Hounsou Ã‰ragon (La Isla) and directed by Edward Zwick (Traffic, the last Samurai) and the always fresh and correct in his interpretations Jennifer Conelly (seeds of bitterness)(, A beautiful mind). Blood diamond is above all a drama that is located in the bloody and brutal do anything any non is? civil war that ravaged Sierra Leone in the 1990s. Set for a good photograph, which includes places without peers and dominated by a hectic pace, not we have the classic film that could well have stayed in a documentary and little more. And is that blood diamond is shot with a huge commercial vision, and not only by its main protagonist terceto, but also for the dynamic tempo, the dialogues somewhat "rears" to our theme, taking into account that all except Jennifer Conelly make Africans. Trafficking and smuggling of diamonds has been a genre which has given many titles to the film, and this is just one more. It is not a great film, but it isn't a horror of which have lately been supporting. Perhaps a bit long, almost two and a half hours, but they made quite bearable. The bad and the good thing about this movie is that it makes you think about the status of the human being, of the value of a life in the abandoned continent and how far it is able to get the man by the money. And I say good because something that encourages you to think is virtuous; the trouble is the conclusion to which you arrive.</body>
