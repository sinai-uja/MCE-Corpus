	<summary>The story is nice, like large and small (do although they ended up getting tired when the party as more humane and less? does Mousetrap?) and as they have captured the French capital is of complete hallucinates.</summary>
	<body>I had many hopes placed in this new installment of Pixar, although I must admit that when I learned of the proposal that this time brought us the team of John Lasseter, imagined that little (say nothing) could count the lives of a rodent in a kitchen, and once again, view once, my opinion may not be more favourable.The story is nice, like large and small (though they ended up getting tired when the party as more humane and less "buzzard") and as they have captured the French capital is of complete hallucinates, especially when I was just a year and see their animations are more realistic and convincing as possible.Pixar is again exceeded what digital animation is concerned, although still not overcome its unfinished business, (humans are still looking like rubber instead of flesh and blood), although again the effects of water (so hard to find in digital animation) as well as the fur of the rodents are quite achieved.It is true that the movie has a change of pace rather curious towards the middle of the footage where one wonders if history comes to more or simply stays there, braking in time, fortunately appears that Pixar realized the "mess" and printed to film more rapidly towards the end of the same, by the way, that no one forget the short project before the movie because it is amazing.The score that Michael Giacchino, is quite good, by true Giacchino is this becoming usual in scores of Pixar, bringing this time certain cuts afrancesados music typical of comedy.</body>
