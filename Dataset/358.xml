	<summary>A tape that will please fans of the Indian director, the rest... will seem more of the same.</summary>
	<body>This is not a typical Shyamalan film, and is, I have to begin by the end, there is no surprise idem, the kind that leave us the mouth open and regretting not giving us has aterioridad; the director of Indian origin made up a real image fairy tale (almost as did Tim Burton with his "Big Fish"), I remember where I read it, the film tribute to the great classics of the 80s, these tapes where people normal were not faced with bizarre situations that a priori exceeded, as well "The girl in the water" is the kinda very good tight wool, which will desmadejando as Hank spend their 90 min. of footage.Paul Giamiatti as Bryce Dallas Howard, are excellent in their roles, Paul knows to interpret altenando the drama with comedy, Bryce falls in love with the House as "Narf" aquatic, while M.Night Shyamalan reserves a "starring" role and not the typical cameo to which we are accustomed, where he tries to get even with the few minutes that appeared on their previous tapes, ultimately everything is round, perhaps the only note discordant is the of lack of final surprise, is that you one when he sees a tape "Made in Shyamalan" is what you expected.In short, a tape that will please fans of the Indian director, to the rest. It seems more of the same.</body>
