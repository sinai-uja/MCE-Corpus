	<body>"A not very awake student is persuaded by the ghost of his twin brother, to take his place as a nightclub showman and wengue his death".Appreciable film, which is perhaps one of the best three performances at the Danny Kaye film, what many won't say much because it is, according to the acerbo popular "supposedly comedian who falls worse than toothache". It is, I think, a good movie, really funny, given that the various genres that converge on the tape do spin, seamless of any kind, with a managed rate of comedy, so it becomes enjoyable from beginning to end. This is always really hard to achieve, so it has much merit. The film was a huge success and view many years later is not surprising. The truth is love enough, despite Kaye, although much credit must be given to a beautiful and always good actress Stonewall may. The rest of the interpretive cast is not feat. I recommend it to have a good time.</body>
