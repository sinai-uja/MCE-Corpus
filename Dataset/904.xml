	<summary>Or the great Bardem, in one of his worst roles, is able to get out of the mediociridad and the anodismo to this tape.</summary>
	<body>Yesterday I was dinner with the co-workers and to which it came, my medium Zucchini I was waiting for. Not with the roller to knead bread in his hand, as in the comics of Zipi y Zape, if not tell me that this film is a truño. That he had seen with his mother and was very bad. Clear, his mother whose light reading the Iliad is not too similar to my reference, but if my half kiwi says that it is bad, is that it is.The film I have no idea of what trafficking. The poster comes Bardem with face of be sucking lemons, as well as little manly. With male who is this man and aflautado that have drawn you. And of course, if it goes from Goya's ghosts, and Bardem isn't Goya, surely the above (of the brush and the palette of painter of fine brush) is going to be what Goya. The Middle I have no idea who is, that I am very hurt. Well, it puts it's Natalie Portman, but I say that not is what makes. what want tell you of a film that I managed not to see? Well no idea, I think that my career as a film critic has bottomed out. Many people thought that he had already done it, but I bought a shovel to dig more in the background, ja, ja, ja.In short, my Paraguayan media that says the movie is a truño, so I am going to apply the suegril influence factor, I'll see what other blogs have given to the movie and released an average of stars for those who do not read the criticism you think it is bad. Terrible it is to have the power to influence the masses;-)</body>
