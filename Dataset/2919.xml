	<summary>Bucolic, pastoral, cinema of Druids and nymphs, impossible love and romantic travestismos. Capricious film of a director of back already commercial Manichaeism.</summary>
	<body>The Magisterium of Eric Rohmer may also fall into cheesy, in the postal bucolic in birds that shades in its branches while the forest nymphs persuasions on love and poetic height of their contenders. Around ninety years and continue in full authority consents to these pastoral rants that mancillan not a gloriously untouchable cinematography, but not I who puts in solfa this obsolete history of sweet plasticity as a language rebañando a jar of jam. I stick to the facts, which are blunt: what Rohmer counts isn't, in itself, disposable. What made me very uphill was the theatricality of the matter, its impostado language, the forced sensationalism of a few characters who talk about contaminated formulas so archaic that they weigh too much in the course of the plot. This rare form of film-making is not scarce at all of interest: Rohmer aims to entertain, exercise of narrator as he always did. Need, by Tutalis, Obelix onstage any loose, carrying a menhir or some juicy wild boar hunting. In the absence of this visual candy, enjoy in what is it gives us: a vigorous show alien to the dictates of the commercialism, checked by a man also alien to the speeches of the industry, illustrating - film film - human emotions, its undisputed Vertigo. In that regard, Rohmer is bold. Their freedom is the most notable of the evidence of this film a contracorriente, who will not like at all who do not comulgue with linguistic artifice. I did half. Not I enjoyed as I do know, but me not bored. Just worth a second viewing.</body>
