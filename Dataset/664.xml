	<body>Composed Guillermo del Toro, a tremendous film, well shot, built on a solid script, without gaps, which makes it perhaps the best of the Mexican director, (with permission of "Cronos", to my taste her another best work), and say it is composed and not directed, because, like Juan Palomo, he does everything, directs, guioniza and produces a tape that, based on the stories that envisioned in his childhoodmixed with the cruel and already distant post-war, leaves the viewer with the mouth open, or even, noses, wanting much more. In fact, this poor mortal, expected eager to the third installment of this, curious trilogy that began with "The Devil's backbone" (another of those master piece of the orondo director) and it will take title "3993" uniting a history, again from the civil war with another current, and a nexus of Union between the two.I I can not anyone in the dark, from Sergi López, as Captain Vidal, which you get to hate and loathe from the beginning until the end of the projection, Maribel Verdú, that has completely changed the concept inept and bobalicón who had her as an actress, Ariadna Gil, that the few minutes that appears on screenpaints, as no one, the suffering of a mother, who knows well that he suffers from no doubt to protect the small Ophelia performed masterfully (and looks that except Dakota Fanning, never a child actor I had come to surprise both) by debutant Ivana Baquero, Alex Ángulo, as the physician of double standards (perhaps his best performance since "The day of the beast" by Alex de la Iglesia), and could not forget me Doug Jones, the man of a thousand faces, to the service of the bull, which had previously worked in "Hellboy" as Abe Sapiens, the companion of adventures of the Red very Devil created by Mike Mignola, giving life on this tape to the labyrinth of the title, before I forget, the thousand and one criticism have come to the conclusion from the resemblance of this tape with the work of Lewis Caroll, "Alice's adventures in Wonderland".I have always loved movies of missions, those where the protagonists have to do a thousand things different, this is one of them, and this double aspect, blending fantasy with the stark reality, is a success, especially when the reality is harsh and cold which rock, and foul and gloomy fantasy (that is perhaps the reason why the film is not for children).Both the characterization of the characters, and this dark picture, sound and even what one can feel by the protagonists is amazing, one from the first minute is based on the motivations of Ophelia in the stubbornness of Vidal, and the fight mercilessly Mercedes out with yours.Anyway, no need too be surprised if I say that the movie I loved, and that everything about her surprise and leaves very good taste.</body>
