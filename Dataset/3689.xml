	<body>Strange mix of genres. A comedy, a parody, which however is able to maintain tension, action, even drama.The must of the parodic comedy has always been the history itself. Soon the gags or jokes just taking prominence, relegating that tells the background. Only rarely, when the comic intensity down a point, and with something to tell, of course, gets the balance just to interest the viewer more than making people laugh.This film succeeds, with very funny moments, but with a pace of action, based on the development of a detective intrigue, which also keeps us interested, and that certainly makes you leave the film in a good mood.I can only recommend it.</body>
