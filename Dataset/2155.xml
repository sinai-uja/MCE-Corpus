	<body>He is supposed to be a comedy, and it really does it have some touches of humor, I would say that it is rather black humour, some might cause them grace and others do not. To my more than make me laugh made me feel identified with the protagonist, and as the protagonist badly passes throughout the film I also I had a pretty bad.The actor who plays the protagonist is Griffin Dunne, have not seen you in any other film that I can remember but here I liked enough, in a role that could easily lend itself to the histrionics manages to do a pretty good performance.The beginning of the movie I liked, especially by the music, that is commonplace in the Scorsese Film, you know always choose a good music to go with the scene.The film becomes very short, perhaps because it has a quick pace, and everything takes place in a single night as indicated by its title in Spanish, a night in which the protagonist passed the rarest things that can happen to a person in New York, when he believes that nothing can go you worse happens a new misfortune, now that I see it from the distance, I find it funny, lol.I do not know if will be imaginations mine, but I've seen influence hitchcockiana in this film (would not be strange), I've seen the protagonist become false guilty pursued, very recurrent in the Filmography of Alfred Hitchcock, and also some camera movements, and specifically at the beginning, when you are in the Office, and the new employee is talking about, their view goes to another place, and while we hear about another character of something that does not matter, what really matters is what tells us the camera, and that is also very Hitchcock.Es a good movie, but nothing more, a mere entertainment, and serves to see the evolution of the film from Scorsese, one of the best directors in history, in my humble opinion.</body>
