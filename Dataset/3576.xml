	<summary>An agglomeration of characters and events that never come to capture our attention, only highlights its sober special effects with the hope of future deliveries to offer that this first part only hinted.</summary>
	<body>Based on the novels of Philip Pullman, directed by Chris Weitz and starring the young Dakota Blue Richards with a long cast of characters played by Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig, Sam Elliott, Eva Green, Tom Courtenay, Simon McBurney, Jim Carter, Ben Walker or Clare Higgins among others, this early December bridge reaches our billboards the Golden Compassfilm that starts a new fantastic saga in the line of the Chronicles of Narnia, the six signs of light or the everlasting Harry Potter.La movie, first installment of a trilogy, puts us in a world parallel to our own, in which humans are a sort of alter ego known as daemon, represented in animal form. Lyra, the protagonist of this story, embark on an adventure without precedents to save two missing friends and expose the Magisterium, an entity which aims to avoid all things that the world knows the existence of dust called an aura, through the daemon, allowing travel to humans through the different parallel worlds.Sad start of fantastic saga is the Golden Compass.Already ignoring the similarities to the adaptation of northern lights it has with the increasingly more prolific fantastic franchises featuring children that flooded our charts in recent years, Chris Weitz film takes place slowly despite the constant agglomeration of events and the saturation of secondary characters that appear and disappear throughout your footage.Thus, although the film succeeds to approach a relatively more mature than other fantastic titles, this isn't more than a sequence of events, but predictable, yes usual, arriving at almost no time to grab our attention: history is monotonous, and only the impressive while sober digital effects achieved that we not depart the look of the screen too oftenin a world with echoes of Victorian London already seen in the franchise of the young Wizard Potter, while more slum, as if of a fantastic key of Dickens novel concerned.On the other hand, it must be said that the approach the Golden Compass offers 'long-term' is far more attractive than the immediate product, with a multitude of parallel worlds barely mentioned in this first installment and the interesting duality between humans and their daemons, which represent the strengths and weaknesses of their owners and maintain a vital link with them. Special mention deserves the criticism that presumably the Golden Compass made to the Catholic Church, disguised under the figure of the Magisterium, as the film (the book, no idea) just Yes allows us to interpret the message, and were it not for the impact this news has had on certain media, doubt rather that no one truly taken it into account.As regards interpretative paragraph refers, we find a solvent but something detestable Dakota Blue Richards in some moments, a totally laughable Nicole Kidman, Daniel Craig anecdotal although very a nice Sam Elliot and a quite sad Eva Green not by your interpretation, but rather by the role that he has had to exercise.In short, barely could highlight the Golden Compass a few sets about extremely credible and friendly daemon, as well as a fairly successful match between polar bears and fantastic.I give it a 5 out of 10.</body>
