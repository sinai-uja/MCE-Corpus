	<summary>A film well directed where the tension accompanies the tape in 99% of the time for footage</summary>
	<body>Once view the film only the can be summarized with a word stress and is that as already happened to me with "The war of the worlds" or "Mission Impossible III", the tension accompanies the tape in 99% of the time of footage.Wolfgang Petersen not only builds a film well directed, but it also goes to the grain to the 10 Min. film, getting certainly proposed since that time, we metamos in the skin of those who are there to suffer; In addition the actors have been shot all the scenes of risk and there we see them with the face of panic, both passing under a Lake of flames, as overwhelmed looking for a possible solution.Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, Emmy Rossum beauty, and with veteran Richard Dreyfuss, are perhaps those ones I liked (almost in this order), and I would even say that Dreyfuss and Russell are worse while those who make you spend in the hour and a half (exact) that takes the tape.Certainly important the score of Klaus Badelt, a film where the that really give the callus that tilda of heroic are heroes for a moment, and as I always say, it accompanies masterfully tension that Petersen throws to the screen.</body>
