	<summary>Amazing film of the most famous comedy trio of the 1970s and 1980s in Spain. Suffers from what you suffer all that they start pretty well but as we are approaching the same resolution, all makes water and loses completely North. Still, highly recommended, and even today.</summary>
	<body>Long time did not see a movie of the caspoteca, and is my medium Zucchini does not see nothing more than women in leather and pathetic dialogues where I see deep social and political criticism and overflowing irony. Well, maybe some women in leather also see, but in anecdotal way. Incidentally, the film background of my baby is already greater than the Spaniard environment.The film is about two families of deep Spain, the Bellotos and the Mondongos. They disputed since before the civil war the property from a well in the middle of a wasteland where only graze goats. One day, in the middle of one of their usual disputes by the above comes to them news posed to take away the land to a nuclear power plant in them. So they begin a series of protests that have such an impact that the Arabs, the Government and the Americans are interested in buy them "his fame".That pleasantly surprised to find this film in my particular caspoteca, which had not made any case so far. It has a start very critic made "the two Spains" fighting for the most insignificant (a well that no one uses or shares). Cane follows giving corrupt politicians only engaged in enriching themselves. Then put us the petrodolares and dollars them Americans, you get the worst of people. And finally tells us that being good is not it reached anywhere and the roost so move them, those who have no scruples. All this dotted with women in leather everywhere (which I remember most seeing) and impudent touching to brighten up the male pupil (the female can fall to the ground of the fright).In short, surprising movie of the most famous comedy trio of the 1970s and 1980s in Spain. Suffers from what you suffer all that they start pretty well but as we are approaching the same resolution, all makes water and loses completely North. Still, highly recommended, and even today.Pity about the end, otherwise it would be almost the best.Besitos.P.D: Anecdotally, I think that it is the first to leave silicone in breasts.Pd2: The scene of the self-destruction of the tape is "Made in Ibañez".P.D.3: And the dialogue of the room of the brothel is delusional.</body>
