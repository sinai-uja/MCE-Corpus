	<summary>Does do both left a lot to be enviable compositions of characters? really? provocateurs.</summary>
	<body>A mockumentary have an undeniable success in box office is something that attracts much attention. And are usually those lockers that some call "transgressors" and others call directly hooligans. There are many ways to shoot "film hooliganism". Either is like torrent, Santiago Segura converted transoceanica franchise, or as Borat character, the character of Sacha Baron Cohen from a perspective more irreverent than rude, apparently, get uncomfortable and violent moments.Borat is a reporter from Kazakhstan to make a story about USA, or as he says US and a. beyond goes with their customs (do someone know Kazakh customs?) and collides frontally with American society and by extension, Western. The reporter is misogynistic, cruel, violent, etc? and why is so well with people from Texas, religious fanatics? and so badly with Jews, women, etc?As any product which must conceal its budget, is shot in a way it is concerned, almost documentary and hidden camera sometimes. Anyway, the fact of knowing is a documentary fiction remains important to the memory of this film that is quite enjoyed during viewing, but loses his bellows to be a fun almost of "innocent innocent" with an intended script Fund.The success of this film can pave the way to the American remake of torrent or be a reference film rude, extreme and even unpleasant and bad taste to remove possibilities to the character of Santiago Segura. Since then I'll stick with Borat, but it is a dilemma, eye, purely commercial. Both have a lot to be enviable compositions of "really" provocative characters.</body>
