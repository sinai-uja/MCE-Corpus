	<body>The other day premiered on the Disney Channel Spanish Youth smash hit High School Musical, musical movie sequel that I already mini defended in his day. My little sister saw her yesterday and recorded it on DVD, and today I could verla.Â¿Expectativas? None at all, so then I not come with those of "Pf! what you expect?". The first was majilla, and it is enough. The story also closed well. A second part which would get would be losing all the little freshness that might have the first part, to be a lot more commercial. In addition, seen the talent that have the Disney Channel to make series and TV movies, it was hoped that the story would be more of the same, and would not provide anything new whatsoever with respect to its predecessor. Only sell CDs and DVDs.And so it has been.High School Musical 2 is a quite considerable bullshit. The argument (which has the "Adventures" of the wildcats in summer) is a joke (when the movie finished, go to a mirror and you see the faces that you have been), and multiply the defects that, in what could be, had the first part: twice as predictable, topical twice, and twice as corny.The musical treatment of the story also makes waters with regard to the first part, and is so so so commercial that it recoils. Do only minimally save What time is it? and I don't dance (although the origin of the latter is also another bullshit), that are at least somewhat marchosas.The rest garbage. Only for fans of the these buds, disneychanneleros, and the more youngsters. Not recommended for over 17 years.At least that you call Andy Stitzer.</body>
