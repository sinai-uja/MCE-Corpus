	<summary>It seems a done homemade film simply to kill the film bug of the own Duchovny</summary>
	<body>Tom is a son of single mother who lives in the Greenwich Village New York, at the dawn of the 1970s. His best friend and co-worker of amusement is mentally limited Concierge of their Institute. When the slow but irresistible over the years becomes an adult Tom, our protagonist decides to embark on a personal quest to reveal you the keys of his childhood and adolescence, with particular emphasis on inquire into the relationship maintained with an enigmatic woman who was part of the prison population from a nearby prison. Through the answers you find, it hopes to grow as a person and thereby improve its difficult relations with those around you and their negative social adaptation, in general. Minor offences belongs to the genre known as generational drama, which aims to simply reflect the difficulties of a person to assimilate the changes inherent in the advent of adulthood. David Duchovny, the famous Fox Mulder from X-files, still greatly burdened by his character in the series of fiction, and fails to make the leap in quality that makes years hopefully. In this production he is screenwriter, director and actor, in what looks like a film made just to kill the film bug of the own Duchovny (he himself stated that he had written the script in a week). His friend Robin Williams, once again, sobreactúa. And if on top of that the female protagonist is his wife in real life, Téa Leoni, since we're almost talking about a home movie. With all this, it is logical that in most parts of the world not have released on film, but directly on DVD. But of course, Spain is different.</body>
