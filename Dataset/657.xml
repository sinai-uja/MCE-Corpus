	<body>I've always refused to accept the equation, universally accepted, according to which good cinema is equal to the sum of the recitals of the protagonists. Even though you want to insist, the performance of Johansson and Harnett leave nothing to be desired. Nor do I accept the excuse that they are not well-chosen. It's the narrative, it is always the narration. "The Black Dahlia" indifferent because it is poorly told.Two policemen share a deep friendship. Both are good fighters and get an unforgettable feat with a match to police. One of them is the boyfriend of Kay Lake (Johansson), the other wants, but respects his friend. One of them is obsessed with the murder of an actress in second row (the case of the Black Dahlia is a true story), the other is a mess with a millionaire.The triangle is not resolved because we do not know from where it is told, nor for who must take sides. We do not understand the dilemma of the protagonist between his heart and his loyalty to the friend. Later, Josh Harnett has to choose between the good woman and the depraved. But today no one is prepared to reject a character to have had homosexual trouble. James Ellroy homophobia is a problem of Ellroy, not ours. To surprise the Viewer, the action takes unexpected dyes and turns make us ask ourselves what we believed. The problem is that we did not expect anything, because during the first hour we have no characters with whom connect or an action clear to engage us, we have a few assumptions that can then fly into a thousand pieces.</body>
