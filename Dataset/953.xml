	<summary>Film really ñoño, implausible, and situations really... absurd. Tasteless comedy in which it is difficult to laugh.</summary>
	<body>When you go by plane, you can do a few things. People mainly try to sleep. Others read. And the rest, see movies. I chose this last yesterday, taking advantage to the airline that flew (step of advertising, which I pay if that xD), put me "The family jewel". and with what I found? As with a film really I ñoño, implausible, and realmente.absurdas situations. The plot is typical: boy introduces girl to his family. Because here they have taken enough footage that is based on silly situations, without grace, and really little credibility.The characters seem to have an inner and outer unwillingness throughout the film. As if he really gave them penalty appear therein. That is really sosa.y also who are going to believe these sudden feelings? Who has seen I think you know what I mean.From here I ask Diane Keaton, never in his life he will read this blog, but I'm like, why he chose to appear in this predictable comedy. And like her, the rest of cast, although perhaps some wanted appear in trade without any kind of profundidad.porque comedies look that her might have had, but not! Will not believe they were going to go out there.</body>
