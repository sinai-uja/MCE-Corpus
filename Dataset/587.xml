	<body>I have always said that there are two parties in question of film criticism: the first, that on the basis of objective criteria issued a verdict; and the second is that regardless of the correction or discrepancy with respect to the usual precepts, appreciates the final result of the production, valuing the effect produced on the audience and focuses on a particular public changing depending on the time and situation. As well, once clarified these points, and in reference to the film "Los Lizenz", I have no other comment on their development: it is one of the films that marked my childhood and her I still have recorded on VHS, that even though a person little fond the comedy, I cannot help but have me everytime I remember specific scenes of her, and is certainly much more witty at times multi-million dollar productions today in day are exported to the world with portentous campaigns. The picture of two beings picturesque Esteso, marvelously escorted by the inimitable Ozores and Pajares is something anyone will keep in their retinas for the remains. It really is a hodgepodge of film, as most of the time to uncover, but does not stop being a reference and a portrait of the Spain of the moment, and without doubt, an opportunity to enjoy a humor uncouth and simplistic, but greater ingenuity than which today offer us. In addition to great affection, save a place of honor in my collection of movies.</body>
