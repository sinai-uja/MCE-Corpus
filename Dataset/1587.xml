	<body>A child, which we might call the pardillo class, becomes friend of the new girl, we could call that will list, and together create a magical world and fantasy where escape from their everyday problems, a world inhabited by trolls, giant, soldiers tiny flying and other creatures, and where they are the masters of everything and reign in harmony. To access this world they pass above the River with a hanging rope, once there will live great adventures and fighting against the Dark Lord.And of course, you see this synopsis, see the trailer, and you read that is the producer of the Chronicles of Narnia, and that you expect? Because a film filled with adventures, chases, fantastic beings and ultimately many special effects. But the reality is rather different, and is that A bridge to Terabithia is more about the problems of two unpopular in school and friendship to children is foja among them later, the film seems begins to move towards something of adventures, just becoming a dram√≥n to beat with a tragedy in its final stretch and whose consequences extend until the end of the film.Special mention should be the father of the boy played by Robert Patrick, an actor every time I see more relegated to second roles and little mounts. A shame because a decade ago it was an actor quite promising.I'm not saying that it is a bad film but is one you sell one thing and then another, and of course because you are disappointed. Despite the film it amuses you and you will like if you have twelve years, if not it is likely to reach a little bored as it was my case.</body>
