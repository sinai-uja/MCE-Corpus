	<summary>A pity that a topic interesting as insanity and genius can become an effective sleeping pill</summary>
	<body>Despite the excitement generated by this film (based on the play by David Auburn, winner of a Pulitzer), my personal opinion is far from most of the criticism. This drama aburrídisimo is not recommended to see at night because it is safer that you not reach credits...Gwyneth Paltrow plays Catherine, the daughter of a brilliant mathematician recently deceased (veteran Anthony Hopkins), who spent the last years of its existence prisoner of a sporadic madness. His daughter has a quite unstable carácer and she fears is fulfilled that proverb of "of such suit such splinter". The film revolves around the figure of the mathematical loco and from his relationship with his daughter we got to "know" better.After the death of Robert, Catherine begins a relationship with Hal (Jake Gyllenhall, best known for his role of atypical cowboy), who was an Assistant to his father in life, Cath who help solve the mystery about some mathematical manuscripts of doubtful authorship. The plot revolves eternally on the authorship of these manuscripts: are creation of Catherine or his father?. It is easy to guess the end. In short, is a pity that an interesting topic as madness and ingenuity can become an effective sleeping pill. Perhaps the director should have deepened more in the psychology of the characters to achieve the complicity of the Viewer. Recommended for fans of Gwyneh Paltrow and for those who fear paste it something from their parents.</body>
