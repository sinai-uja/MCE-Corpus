	<summary>It will delight lovers of Clooney, good performances, lawyers and films with a background and that good intentions and the honour due to the temptations.</summary>
	<body>Debut in the direction of the screenwriter Tony Gilroy, who despite having a large cast, not just making a film that deserves my recommendation, and the main reason is the ballast which is the first part of the footage. The best of this proposal are the actors that has. Find George Clooney, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton and Sydney Pollack interacting, is something that deserves to be seen, but the style you have chosen the director, with the flashback of four days, makes us do the first part too confusing, with many details, information and situations in which is not known well that think. Later revealed us the shed that has formed, dazzling us with a story that raises the flight and makes us understand what we are experiencing. Nevertheless, the burden is too heavy, and in my view, the film does not have enough strength to get out of layers of cold air. I understand that people who see in "Michael Clayton" a great film, the second part is there are, with sensational performances (the Palm is for Wilkinson), but could have been a product much better. In short, "Michael Clayton" will delight lovers of Clooney, good performances, lawyers and films with a background and that good intentions and the honour due to the temptations.</body>
