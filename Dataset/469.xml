	<body>The recent death of the "crocodile hunter" Steve Irwin is a good context to speak of this documentary film directed by Werner Herzog, director known for films like Fitzcarraldo and Aguirre, the wrath of God and that recounts the life, work and death of activist Timothy Treadwell.Treadwell was a guy obsessed with the protection of bears grizzly in Alaska and every yearfor thirteen years, he traveled to Alaska to spend the spring and summer only in the middle of the bears, not just looking for studying them but to live with them and in a sense be one bear; Treadwell recorded in video and audio all his travels and in his spare time traveling free schools and television programmes teaching about these animals and the need to protect them.However the risks that ran Treadwell passed him the account and in October 2003, almost at the end of one of his trips, the and his girlfriend Anne Huguenard were killed and devoured by one of the bears who swore to protect. The documentary, narrated by the own Herzog, both grouped Treadwell filming as interviews with friends, relatives and detractors, as well as the forensic study of the remains of Treadwell and his girlfriend; in this sense the documentary does not seek to glorify the Treadwell figure it is clear by their way of thinking that the type was not entirely in their comprehensive.Maybe the more salvageable of the documentary is that at the end we can understand that they meant these animals for Treadwell and while it is a dramatic history and terrible in its outcome, is a testament to the dignity that there is something extremely worthy to die doing what you love. This is an unmissable film, five stars and this DVD in zone 1.</body>
