	<body>So bad and predictable as I expected. There is no doubt that the third part of the saga Saw was already a tremendous insult to the film. It will be terorífica and what you want, but his scripts are truly abysmal. Saw IV falls again in the topical to disguise that craving so gore of the director, to cover these murders of unpleasant consequences and give them a little more than felt. The characters are poorly described, the reasons of Tobin Bell (right, above all) to cut these people are ridiculous, especially seeing how are tortured, way to exageradísima and vomitiba. And it is that I have no desire or reason to dwell more. This fourth and unfortunately not last installment is just as bad and unpleasant as the previous. His argument is pathetic, and with its end just feeling embarrassed. And I have no doubt that I alquilaré the first, not only by the critical acclaim that he obtained, but also to get out me the idea that the Saw saga is one of the worst made insults to the movies latest. But, without a doubt, the fourth is incredibly painful, a hodgepodge of care.</body>
