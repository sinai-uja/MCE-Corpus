	<summary>A fairly honest film that is out of the middle of the Spanish film.</summary>
	<body>In the new film by Manuel Mart√≠n Cuenca ("the weakness of the Bolshevik"), the co-writer and director he opts for a structure of crossed stories. And manages to make them attractive, which is already an achievement. The most diverse characters but nothing almodovarianos (except for Watling) get plagar history with everyday situations without the current pamphleteering nature that would portray a social worker in work of assistance to immigrants, a Cuban who tries to earn a living and to an ex-convict who tries to get ahead.The actors are great and well chosen, but the worse is surprisingly is Javier camera in a role that doesn't give many options to records (either them would not give). The script is very interesting and is well exploited. However the pace (lasts two hours although it could have removed 15 minutes perfectly) is quite irregular, making some sequences in an authentic invitation to disconnect from the movie. The music is not well used. His aesthetic (grain and very washed colors) gives a more realistic touch.However what most attracted me, and did quite some time not me it happened with a Spanish film, except for "The method", it is the script. The best movie is realizing that human inconsistencies are unlimited and are shown in many ways: social worker who helps immigrants and is not capable of dealing with his own son, the newly out of prison that once released locks himself in memories?A good option to watch on dvd. A fairly honest film that is out of the middle of the Spanish film.</body>
