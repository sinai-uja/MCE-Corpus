	<body>A King in New York is another great parody to the "new" ills befalling to Charles and the world. An effective and at the same time quite harmless satire. From television and the incessant advertising; passing by the ruthless Mc Carthy and its despotic laws; rock &amp; roll in cinemas, until you reach himself - declined and frustrated - along with his alleged and so promoted communism. In the first 20 minutes we hear his characters things such as USA is the country of the "total freedom"; We see his ex-wife disinterested money of their separation; and a still more personal phrase: "go, is always to die a little." Shadov is a species of most covering Verdoux, but by no means least wise.Paused - at times peca's inconsistent-, but with that pace himself and vital, between LucasArts and honeyed, that he was born with Monsieur Verdoux and limelight and is projected; a true icon of the film.
