	<summary>Lovers of diving maybe you like, but we will if you are doubtful, as I was before seeing her!Flee from it like the plague! (Vaaaamos).</summary>
	<body>I spoke of the film makes enough, in the wording of the page in which I collaborated habitually, and honestly, when I saw the trailer this summer not too caught my attention, while I had heard quite a few opinions, some good and some bad (everything as botica) However today that had a free moment I have arranged to see her and I can only say that I was disappointed a lot; made with digital image, last milestone in film and last nonsense that many directors have brought to display a much more realistic image, and above the everlasting based in facts real to give us almost to title of "dogma of faith" an argument that follow foot juntillas and which at times is simpler and more boring than he expected when I started to see it!And that just takes 79 minutes! (not sure I stay asleep in the armchair).The tape only has a couple of notable moments and sometimes even reminded me the infinity of tapes that I get to see everytime I visit some friends (newlyweds) to their homes after a vacation/honeymoon or anything else. The epilogue is perhaps the most shocking and ultimately somewhat unexpected a priori has been what has made me be able to change position in the armchair in which homer Simpson was already making a small hole to sleep.Lately "Artisan" (an independent distributor and that shone not long ago with their high-quality tapes) me doing see each truyo size!Cosmic!Anyway, maybe diving lovers you like, but we will if you are doubtful, as I was before seeing her!Flee from it like the plague! (Vaaaamos).</body>
