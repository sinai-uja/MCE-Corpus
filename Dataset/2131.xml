	<body>Directed by Bryan Singer in 1995 it has become a cult film, as at the time it was very innovative and renewed the foundations of the genre. It is now a very interesting film with some pretty good performances, although not surprised as it did in its day, because we're too accustomed to the script turns and tricks to give us an unexpected ending.The entire film is told by the character of Kevin Spacey, a cripple who is involved in a fire in a ship which killed 27 people, a policeman played by Chazz Palminteri interrogates him to try to find out the truth. A truth that we will not know until the end, with a mysterious character named Kaiser Soz√©, which will be the key to everything.Kevin Spacey makes it one of his best performances, along with Seven and American Beauty the best of his career. Others are also good, although Benicio del Toro is something artificial for my taste.The script is great, all the pieces are perfectly placed in the typical movie that leaves you thinking awhile when just to check if everything fits. If you let you carry by the story the end will surprise you.</body>
