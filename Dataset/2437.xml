	<summary>Vulgar movies, reminiscent of Mariano Ozores. Stereotypes, anachronisms and lack of ingenuity. To then say that Spanish cinema lost viewers because it is not promoted.</summary>
	<body>Starring Pepón Nieto, Concha Velasco, Rosa María Sardá and Pablo Puyol, among others, Chuecatown tells the story of a pair of homosexuals to be unwittingly is linked to a mobster who kills elderly women who occupy certain houses, with the intention of reforming them and sell them at high prices to young people and wealthy.The line to misery of the spectator, prevailing in the Spanish light comedy, Chuecatown employs a humor full of clichés, vulgar, lacking in originality and extremely predictable, with some characters caricatured in excess and a script full of gaps and defects of form.The histrionics is the prevailing note in the characterization of the characters, and both Pepón Nieto and Pablo Puyol bordering the ridiculous at times, while Rosa María Sardá demonstrates once again that it is capable of playing all kinds of roles.Perhaps its director Juan Flahn, you somehow wanted to demonstrate that homosexuality is one subject like any other, and that can be used in any context. But certainly, disservice has done to normalize using few stereotypes can underpin today in the minds of a citizenship which can be seen in this film more reminiscent of Mariano Ozores than anything else. Except, obviously, that at the time of the destape productions were financed by private capital in almost all, while we now have a cinema subsidized from all conceivable sectors. Perhaps having guaranteed repayment of the production before start, is the cause that led to the Spanish to the progressive and slow film, unstoppable, but loss share of screen, fund-raising, and the interest of viewers seeking something more than a nude or an exaggerated darse.</body>
