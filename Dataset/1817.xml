	<body>Lately they are very fashionable off-road managers, and it is that there is no longer a director to be devoted and a type of cinema in particular and, like churros do all films in series, no, now managers make an and thousand tapes different, any cut by the same pattern, understand, that as human beings they are, they have to pay the mortgage, as any child of neighbour who boasts, and hence the filmic diversity, but come on, about Cassavetes, it is already night court, since that titles that we find in his filmography ranging from the classic "Delta Force" to the unbearable "diario de Noa", it is now distancing itself with this film, which today is the most boring movie I remember in a long time.We started with a Bruce Willis caracterizad√≠simo and unrecognizable, where after layers of latex and airbrush see actor of "The glass jungle" as the local drug capo, then we have Sharon Stone, which, applying the same this is a mother who in a flashback almost captures us what happened, after Emile Hirsch as a rapper camel, after them Ben Foster (perhaps the best of the film)(, although quite overact) and Justin Timberlake, which after two movies you still being on screen quite lost.The script is confusing, boring, slow and little real, when it is assumed that you want to capture reality through the pores, but no, fails, everything is so easily recognizable, that one can recognize the tape a thousand similar films (go no further "Wonderland" which starred Val Kilmer.).The use of split screen is useless, since the Division points to the same, and nothing different, view it 2 times, come on, that is "chuli" and overprinting of the time, witnesses and such is indifferent.A crappy fledged now I understand why has taken so long to release.</body>
