	<body>As I have read a review about this movie, I'm going to summarize, for once I I culturization. It is that he was asked to Miyazaki (again him) a medium of entertainment for a few airlines, in such a way that their passengers clear mind and soul. But he was encouraged with the theme and created a film, rather than as requested. This is the reason why leave at first titles in many languages. That should explain everything.The film is a pig to fly seaplanes (so said, bad it is). It is before it was human, but disenchanted with humanity became pig. How live the rise of fascism in her country, at the end of the 1920s, decides to deserting the army and become a bounty hunter. Despite being a pig, he is the best pilot and it has encandilada most beautiful women from the bar of seaplanes, one such Gina. And then things go and out the air pirates more stupid than a mata of beans.Well, if we exceeded the first scene of the pilot pig, have before us a great animated film. The script and the development of the same is pretty well, though not to be sublime. Rather it seems to be geared towards a more youthful adult audience. History of the pork is good, although not understood as Gina fell in love with him. It should be a lesson that the director gives us about watching people inside and that. The action scenes are sympathetic with pirates always grace of idiots who are. In addition, is the kind that never seen die to anyone (although Yes die) so it is pleasant.In short, it's okay. It is not a wonder, as many would have us believe, but can be seen by both children and adults. I recommend.Besitos.P.D: Rent Porco Rosso its islet?Pd2: Porco Rosso means pork Crimson, heh, heh. You're a Crimson pig, a Crimson pig you are!</body>
