	<summary>Jessica Alba, penguins and a story midway between the cinema of the brothers Farrelly and compulsive liar...</summary>
	<body>Lions Gate not only make film of terror (Saw and all its damn sequels), but which in the USA has unmarked with this comedy starring Jessica Alba and Dane Cook unknown, one of those romantic comedy that at times recalls situations mad, absurd and eschatological film of the Farrelly and also something like what did Tom Shadyac in "Compulsive liar" together these 2 films and is obtained which today brings us.And is this tape has raised in the USA ($35,017,297) and it worked relatively well there, being 8 weeks at the box office, at full capacity, yet not premiered in our country, so we write a more to this endless list of releases that cross the pond when the distributor of shift want you (in this case the Lions Gate) and then protesting because results at box office, they are expected, nor are as rewarding as I thought initially, and is that the panacea of the cinema today, not only does harm in piracy and all that stuff, but in the release dates that are becoming increasingly blurred.After this allegation which, as always, will fall on deaf ears, and only serve to be a little thatched in criticism of the critical turn, continue with the film stars Jessica Alba, here, brilliant in the role of a clumsy and clueless beauty (for that has to work much, nor lack that makes.), also join in the film working with penguins, they are always my favorite animals, and you will know without work you as minimum that the tape, as well as entertain me a lot (the hour and a half short are happened to me flying) found it me very fun and rewarding.About Dane Cook (almost protagonist of the film, rather than Alba), we could be before an out, like Jim Carrey of the Saturday Night Live actor, which could, as Jim be these actors, histrionic, but not power, and with 4 gestures get, like the actor of Ontario, provoke laughter from the audience for my part, I loved his performance, and in some moments (of the Oronda girl) of the best comedy I've seen in a long time.And of course, the topics of boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy loses girl, and boy recovers (or not) girl.In short:!Which I has encantao, cojona!</body>
