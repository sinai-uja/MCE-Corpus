	<summary>An excellent comedy youth, debt of tapes as "Jo night" or "All in a day"... Like friends and strangers.</summary>
	<body>For a time this part well for working reasons, either for personal reasons, I am missing much of the press passes that Muchocine.net provides us with to go, and it had to be my good friend Plissken who strongly recommend me viewing of this film, which already had in mind, but the helping hand of a friend always helps right?It is clear that this film, this pensanda that the chavaler√≠a have fun at the movies, and while "American Pie" and similar films marked a before and a later in the comedy recent American this time, "Supersalidos" gets not only overcome with a vengeance to the saga of Apple Pie, but also at times get, not only that laugh (that you ries), but also make us think and see a reflection of which many have been, if, with the age of the Portas I was also quite "pardillo" in the 3 members.Great both Michael Cera, Christopher Mintz-Plasse as and of course I cannot forget me Jonah Hill, impressive, taking the reins of the tape on its side more geek and carefree.On the other hand, there is a name, which comes lately glued to the comedy with a solid staple difficult to separate, I am referring to Seth Rogen, as a modern King Midas, making gold and taquillazo sure everything thing that touches, or where it comes.It was the 2nd Act the tape loses a tad of bellows, but well, that's no problem for her final Fireworks.In short, I do not want to lengthen, an excellent youth comedy debtor tape as "Jo night" or "All in one day". Like friends and strangers.</body>
