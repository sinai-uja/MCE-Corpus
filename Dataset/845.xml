	<body>Boring, pompous, poorly performed? disappointment in the a priori interesting the illusionist fledged.Fat disappointment because there is only something worse than a bad movie: a movie bad and pretentious.This history? from a magician that? well? does going for? there a? flashback?There is argument nor the actors seem to be enjoying their work: Eduard Norton was never so bad (well, in The Score can if) and that if, as novelty offers an interpretation of the Steven Seagal school, that way of frown; Paul Giamatti should have a hole in your agenda, Sewell takes a ridiculous mustache and the Biel? leaves.Photography isn't all prodigious one expects, and the soundtrack of the Philip Glass alguno tries to look like Mr. M (add him a red hood also if you want to?), causing a surfeit of epic proportions in the Viewer.There is no emotion, or a more or less solid plot, and it shows horrors that unlike The Prestige, which was based on a novel by consistent, this one is based on a short story and if what I say is that this story would give for a single episode of The Twilight Zone rather than presenting a arrogant and sosavery bland movies for those who like their mothers.As El Zorro, but without action and humor, this is a serious and prestigious movie. Who has been the luminaries of the New York Post stating that it is one of the best films of the year?Do and indeed, of la moraleja which is sensed, best or speak, but suspect that the screenwriter is a type of dubious morality? It is so sadder that it is not worth compared with Christopher Notan. No I was bored so much in a cinema from Wolf, that gem of terror perpetrated Mike Nichols makes a few añazos. One of the several absolute of the season that has come before the other?</body>
