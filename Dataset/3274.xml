	<body>The horror genre has experienced many ups and downs throughout its history, good horror movies have been made but many more have been which could be described as "commercial basurilla". The orphanage, though it is commercial, can be included among the films of terror by quality, full of elements already seen thousands of times in other films such as doors closing alone, sounds strange in a house alone, a child who sees dead, etc, but despite these elements the movie doesn't become one rehash of others of its kindThanks to a good script, an excellent photography and some notable performances, especially that of Bel√©n Rueda, which carries the entire weight of the film on it. The mixture of horror and drama in the orphanage is what more drew me attention, with an ending that makes more than one tear, is one of the best endings I remember, but I think it might have been spared the last scene, which gives us information that we really don't need, but it would have been a great climaxbeautiful and sad, very sad.</body>
