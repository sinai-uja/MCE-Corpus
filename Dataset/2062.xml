	<summary>The best, without doubt, interpretations of the 3 main characters.</summary>
	<body>Tracy is a girl of 13 years of Los Angeles that loses his innocence through the influence of the most popular girl in the Institute, introduced into a world of sex and drugs which makes it radically change of attitude towards his family. His mother, Mel, who is alcoholic, try desperately to understand and help.The screenplay for this film wrote it the Director along with Nikki Reed, the girl who plays Eve (the most popular of the Institute), and is based on what happened to her when she was 13 years old. This makes that the characters are very well built and very real.Although this truth also influence the interpretations of the actresses, Evan Rachel Wood is the protagonist, which undergoes a dramatic shift in a very short time, conveys very well the desperation that is below the layer of makeup and brazenness of Tracy; Holly Hunter is the mother of Tracy, is divorced and is alcoholic, although he is trying to leave it and in no time we see drunk; Nikki Reed plays the friend of Tracy. Eve has no parents, goes to live with her mother and Tracy and decisively influencing the lives of the two. It is a character unbalanced very well played by newcomer Nikki Reed, perhaps because lived the history very closely.The best, without doubt, interpretations of the 3 main characters.</body>
