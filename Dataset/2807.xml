	<summary>Too many ups and downs with memorable moments and other of authentic boredom give a great irregularity leaving us half-way in a project where expected much more.</summary>
	<body>Comes the other half of the film GRINDHOUSE where sorprendementé is quite more loose than PLANET TERROR of Rodríguez. why I think it is surprising? Because any fan that can meet the filmographies of both authors will agree in the superiority of talent that is overflowing with Mr TARANTINO to his colleague.But it is clear that in is occasion Rodriguez understood that was the draft and we much more amused with a badass, fun, proposal in line with a series b ZOMBIES old-fashioned.It is not that the film before us should be totally despicable, has a really marvelous last Chase, KURT RUSSELL returns to demonstrate his enormous charisma and the beauty of the actresses wanders without complexes to the delight of our eyes.But it is a film that makes long before endless dialogues that are not to the heights of the master in what is one of their strengths. Too many ups and downs with memorable moments and other of authentic boredom give a great irregularity leaving us half-way in a project where expected much more.</body>
