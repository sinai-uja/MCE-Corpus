	<body>The truth is that for some time that he wanted to see time of brave, but between one thing and another it has been several months until one fine day in the last week I decided to serve me a gin-tonic, get the slippers and sit on television to enjoy or suffer the film. He had good image of one of its protagonists, Diego Peretti, which he had seen another job, No sos vos, soy yo, that left me an excellent taste. The Argentine environment, the accent of its people and the freshness of their characters I embauc√≥ from the beginning. The dialogue seemed superbly built, demonstrating a mastery of language, Double Entendre and the irony that already began to give by lost in the world of current celluloid. The complicity between Peretti and Luque conveys confidence and naturalness, as the ratio of any pair of good friends. At times the indent of Fund is simplicity, that although it performs its function of portraying without acrimony the corruption of the police forces of the Argentine State, it could have been better assembled, because in this case the sum of the parts is better than the total. With this I mean that it is the typical film that with the passage of time remember specific scenes but forgets the argument. With everything and that, I think a great film to laugh enjoy the Latin American lightweight comedy, which demonstrates once again that the lack of resources is often become a spur which sharpens the wit of creators that since outweigh economic deficiencies affecting the South American film industry.</body>
