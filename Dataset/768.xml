	<body>UY uy, uy, go towel with the poster of yore. A Lady of Orange hair that screams as if you were to give a host and melt you. A guy with hand cut into position in the fight, and a pale man with idly seems bad. And an aesthetic Matrix, this seems action in abundance, coups and others. Ja, ja, ja, as always nothing to do with reality.The movie not be that is. Leaves a woman with orange hair that gives to another a cube (not of scrub, if not as a square but in three dimensions) and then give a beating and try to burn. But she escapes and is mounted in a taxi where there is one face silly. The silly face then going to a campus of those party and dies a girl before him, which is why everyone believes that he is. These flees and leaves a fat telling you that either returns a few movies or miss you your home. And then remember its past with the Orange hair and finally girl just and you think "do the cualo?"Well, nothing, than this is a drama of a kid who does bad things in youth and then go you to invoice at maturity. The Swedish film shows, once again, that can be just as bad as anyone else, including the Spanish, and many sexual liberation, but nothing resping√≥n nipple nipples. The actors are rare, rare, highlighting the taxi driver, which could well be Spanish. I was waiting for all the movie that put the COPE or el Fary in the cassette, but has not failed. That Yes, driving as the here. The action scenes are pretty sad and pathetic, apart from having scenes that could well be mess. I.e., that pull the scenes outdoor and mounted them in another way, the movie would the same poop.In short, nothing of the cow in a Swedish drama that has nothing to envy to any national or imported shit.</body>
