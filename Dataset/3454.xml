	<summary>Interesting science fiction film shot with not many dollars, but imaginative and achieved.</summary>
	<body>2A a stranger and distant planet goes to a space ship with some forty people, among them a dangerous prisoner. The captain of the ship, to save, is attempting to get righted the ship and save himself, launch weight, among them the rest of the passengers, but fails it. Upon landing you will discover that the planet has two Suns that take turns. They see remains of animals, their bones rather, even a ship with no crew. "Soon they discover that they are not alone, as by an inappropriate eclipse will appear thousands of strange creatures that eat humans".Modest but nice product of science fiction, where it passes the time, although it has obvious drawbacks to put him.The worst are clumsy and falsely funny dialogues, more of one topical thousand times seen on the screen and a taciturn and poor psychological study of the characters, something that is crying out the footage because we have just not knowing anything of any of them.The best (and is what gives interest) is the use of the few means at its disposal, with a high climax in the narrative, enhancing the intrigue and the surprise factor. It is not that this is much, but the Viewer does not lose interest in the future of the characters and how the movie is rather short so does not tire in no time.The end, incidentally, although lengthened for free, has certain force and isn't too complacent with the Viewer, what is to be welcomed. In addition, irregular and modest, but entertaining.</body>
