	<body>Love has been a source of inspiration in all fields of art, numerous films do as the protagonist, and many people it craves and seeks idealizes.Paris is known as the city of love, and why they have decided to make a choral work in which eighteen directors show a district of the French capital, with love as a central axis of their stories. Movies with several stories have always I attracted, while it is true that a balance between all of them is very difficult, and only great managers, based on good scripts manage to achieve this.In Paris, Je T´Aime can find several small jewels, which are far above the rest of shorts that make up this journey through the city of the Eiffel Tower. In this small group can include the parts of Tom Tykwer ("Run, Lola, run", "perfume"), Alfonso Cuarón ("children of men"), Oliver Schmitz, the Coen brothers, Gus Van Sant and Wes Craven, although if I have to stay with one, starring Natalie Portman, takes the cake.Various stories about love, that will come to each differently, making some us closer than others. In Paris, Je T´aime shows us love in different ways, featuring and embodied by characters of different nationalities and ethnic groups, and between all them we find actors of the stature of Natalie Portman, Nick Nolte, Steve Buscemi, Bob Hoskins and Elijah Wood to name a few.Ultimately the film is presented as an interesting option, which will satisfy the lovers of Paris and of the multiple stories.</body>
