	<summary>An offense free youth already itself has quite a few problems, and who does not deserve a paniaguado of State subsidies to come to stigmatize her.</summary>
	<body>With a title like this, and with the initial scenes, one well could imagine is to a film that revolves around the world of boxing. Nothing further from the truth.Shock is a social drama which chronicles the experiences of a group of girls to the vicissitudes of the life of the humble people, decide to devote to dock jewelry stores and other shops. A great example.With a simpleton, diffuse and weakly assembled argument, the film unfolds with difficulty, shuffling a final neither expected nor is expected, because the more approaches, less matter to a boring spectator.Giving an abhorrent picture of the humble and young people, the film uses all possible topics, probably because the charge for the script of this production is far from the world that seeks to portray; It is the only explanation I can find for so much free offense to a youth which already has quite a few difficulties to succeed a subsidized and paniaguado of the State come to stereotype her.Nothing to argue from the point strictly technical of the film, while in the interpretative aspect, the correction is the dominant note. Neither can be a much better these wicker basket.They will then tell you that Spanish Cinema triumphs not by fault of publishers, viewers, cinemas, etc. It is certainly the easiest, because much harder for these liberals of grout would recognize their inability to connect with the public and tell stories interesting and real and not canned junk written with the only desire to charge the Government aid.</body>
