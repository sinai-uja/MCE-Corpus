	<summary>Get scare and in what way. REC will be a before and an after in the genre.</summary>
	<body>Nothing to do with that is soft history proposed by the orphanage, REC starts without presentations, bareback and takes us by the hand of the intrepid reporter until the first bite of the old, that honestly I impresiónó by the realism with which it is shot.It is true that the use of the camera in hand had already seen before in the blair witch project, but nothing to see hear. The project next to REC is an episode of the Smurfs at 3 and a half in the afternoon. If the draft masca tension, but the end is the closest thing to a coitus interruptus. You scared for more than one hour and then leave you on tenterhooks.Fortunately REC manages to scare and in what way. The lost girl scene is impressive, the camera approaching his face is priceless. Personally I had never seen filming the horror so closely. Great work once again of Balagueró, not so great performance of some actors, somewhat forced. And the plot what I can tell, does absurd?, the truth is that I do not care, for frames I read a book. Terror Cine-Espectáculo to 100%.At the moment we are already seeing the sediment that is leaving this movie in the cinema in films like Cloverfield (Monstruoso) and many more will continue to the technique of the genius of Spanish terror. Balagueró and olé.</body>
