	<body>In one of my sleepless nights, I found myself (who was going to be but) watching a programme of canal +, therein, a critic of film, Carlos Boyero for more sign, desbarataba thousand and one films, talked about because this man the tape that now brings us, viciously, with hatred and speaking of as Soderbergh had transmitted on screen a true reflection of the classic film, that server is not a follower, and is that viewing this tape, from beginning to end, one feels attracted to a nearly obsolete, old cinema that shone for the years beyond 50.Tal time, the argument and the mystery shines by its absence, and admittedly, at times one is left apabullar by the images and the master of the "tracing" and bit by what happens on the screenSince in some momenos it comes to seem dull, boring and intrasdencente.Clooney, alma mater of the project, listed as illustrious protagonist, accompanied by a Tobey McGuire that it is difficult to separate from the character that has made globally famous (I was looking for the moment in which, although the suit opened in black and white and trepara by the walls of Berlin), Cate Blanchett, in a role that could have perfectly interpreted those heroines of the film noir", this expléndida in his role, with some dark contact lenses to hide her beautiful blue eyes, can not forget me coral, secondary cast including Leland Orser, who I have always associated with that crappy copy of"Seven"to protagonizadaba Christopher Lambert called"Resurreción".""There are a lot of good Germans" (one of the first sentences of the film), which seems to be the initial premise that Soderbergh part for haunting us with their images, accompanying them with a classical score reminiscent of what intended, a cut pattern of the cinema of yesteryear.In short, a current tape, passed by the classic tapestry that reconciles the current cinema, with the classic film lovers, an easy way to make a link between both styles.</body>
