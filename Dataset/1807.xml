	<body>I saw Laura because they provided. I saw Laura boredom. I saw Laura without enthusiasm. I saw Laura without wanting to. I saw Laura. And after seeing Laura, only say would buy me on DVD, which removes boredom, you are excited, and that could see a thousand times.Let's go by parts. I don't know who is the director. I do not know who are the actors. I do not know who are the writers. I do not know who composed the soundtrack. Sorry for my ignorance. But the truth, do not think it necessary to enjoy this film.The truth: give me some laziness talk about this film. In addition, the note I gave speaks for itself. And I think that he says. pebbles I hear. said... IT IS A PELICULÓN.And is a peliculón at all (I said all) aspects. Direction, script, actors. All. The most admirable of the film is that (as almost all the great films of history) it has not lost its strength. What is more, it keeps it intact. And hit me with that force. I am not going to disclose nothing of the argument, but I hope that they see.The only thing I can do to motivate them to see her is tell you more they wanted many now have the genius of days gone by, because if something makes gala the tape of his genius. A genius that knows how to deal with the viewer and as shredding the history so that the end is exciting. And together, to make the film the seed on their own merits.</body>
