	<body>I'm going to refrain from entering the debate about whether "Dreamgirls" is or not a biopic of the Supremes, and if so, whether it is good or bad. The truth is that I know little more than anything about the lives of these ladies, and is not something that remove me the dream. What do I question is that this film version of the Broadway play is also a musical. Because it is not. Or, at least, not during all the time. And why "it thumping" when they begin to sing each other. In a musical code that half of the action will run between the songs and dances of the protagonists, and the content, probably won't be very complex and you're subject to the form you accept from the outset. However, if you begin with a story about a group that strives to reach fame - and reasonably, includes scenes with their actions, continue with a pair of musical dialogues, and finish, again, leaving aside this type of resources, at the end there is one thing that is puzzling. And not only that, but the lightness with which the film passes over conflict is somewhat excessive for anything which - I repeat - is not a musical.Incidentally, "Dreamgirls" is quite entertaining and nimble, albeit at the cost of trying to cover too much and not getting more than a superficial way. Does Beyoncé passes the test without problems, although it is funny that with the promotion of this film happened the same thing which tells it, and that the excantante of Destiny? s Child've done you tantísima shade to Jennifer Hudson, authentic protagonist and a lot better actress. But there are prizes - the Oscar as a CODA - to compensate.</body>
