	<summary>The Borgia is a television product badly adapted to the cinema.</summary>
	<body>In the battle of labyrinth against the Borgia, Telecinco Antena 3 against, I have seen the quality of the second Boxer. And the truth, did not lack two hours and fourth film to verify the boredom of the new movie of Antonio Hernández. the truth, I hope that in the city without limits was not a cluster of large coincidences, because an overproduction of this caliber could not have been a "consecration" for a director. However Los Borgia is a television product badly adapted to the cinema.Although the pomposity of the sets follow telling us that the artistic Bill almost always goes well, dialogues and mounting not help at all to create an epic product, as it should have been.To begin with the "shocking" aspects, Sergio Peris Mencheta, which has a serious dilemma between his appearance of pimp with his diction at times incomprehensible at times defined by some almost comic screams; María Valverde, which may be all the "revelation" that they want, but which has been a terrible choice for portraying a woman with alleged character; dialogues, totally corny and badly interpreted. By many "who are you?" to write, you can say as if you were at the Academy of A step forward. Well, and as a final point against, the duration and rhythm. Obviously, if we are talking about a television product, digestion must be faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaacil, which the characters have to explain absolutely everything (associated with the above dialogues) and everything has to be a little subtle.But things are welcome to see in this film is the talent of Lluis Homar, the mastery of Ángel Illarramendi and good to make Javier salmon. But of course they are not virtues that make me recommend seeing this movie. I am sorry.</body>
