	<body>It goes without saying that to me the idea of a Mutant Ninja turtles seemed to me always a stupid. It was funny that the master was called sphincter and was a rat, but little else. Nor made me grace his humor, his fights or na na. A sinsorguez of superheroes.The film is about a few large turtles as gentlemen with a moustache who have a father who is a rat of the same port. Apparently are slightly separated, when their leader went to Latin America to strengthen, remaining that made a sindios. Upon his return, must recover the spirit family, to save the world from monsters, more about ninjas, more about Lords of stone with bad milk, most do not remember what. Come on, a mogollon to about tortuguitas.Let's see, the film has entertained me enough to not bore me. I personally think that has lacked a lot action and that they have rolled in the problems of the families in excess, especially with the turtles. The superheroes must not have as rich inner lives, we like es den of mamporrazos against unlikely wicked and things as well. Let's see if they succeed understand the writers. Otherwise, the argument is interesting, not original and is facilitated. It is directed towards a rather juvenile, since that is too dark and public menace for kids.In short, if we have 4 turtles large ninjas as pigs, a rat as a San Bernardo, 13 deadly monsters, thousands of little ninjas, 4 brothers of stone and an immortal brother, why not spend the whole film distributing sopapos? Long roll and little match. Although I liked it.</body>
