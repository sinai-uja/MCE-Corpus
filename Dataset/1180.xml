	<body>Winning in the latest edition of the Sitges festival, "Hard Candy" is presented as a serious work, tough, almost theatrical, with only two characters and always on the same stage, where the action takes place here in the psychological horror and where both the victim, as the executioner, changes all the time, and you do not know very well from that side position.With regard to interpretations, both (both that of Patrick Wilson and Ellen Page) master, both provide the necessary dose of sanity/insanity that demand their characters, perhaps, the only discordant note is that not it gives us time (in just 90 mins.) to delve into the lives of the characters, we do not know their concerns, nor the motive which leads them to act that way.One of the flaws with the script, perhaps, are some somewhat "ridiculous" situations that appear almost in the last 15 min. footage, trying to give an air of "Teen-horror film" not needing, otherwise, a crippling and "theatrical" Thriller that keeps you glued to the seat from beginning to end.</body>
