	<summary>Excellent Spanish film, which ends with a somewhat diffuse and little concise final</summary>
	<body>Very often I usually review a library near Lavapies, I do not know, is a small space, almost as if it was a friend's House, and there, between books and good music, not long ago I found the novel of "The education of a fairy" Ddier Van Cauwelaert, which Jose Luis Cuerda has made an adaptation, and which moreover rope makes a cameo appearance in one of the scenes.A tape, which is almost a fairy tale for adults, where Ricardo Darin makes a character that somehow reminds Roberto Begnini in "life is beautiful", trying to show him to the kid that life isn't as ugly as it appears, sweetening with fairies, Giants and desires.Lately it is difficult to watch movies where come children, that, as said a director whose name I do not now remember, it is complicated making movies "with children", put that these tend not to behave on screen as they would really out of it, this is the case of the kid co-star of the tape, and is that it for a long time (perhaps from Dakota Fanning) that it did not see a kid as repipiresabiado, repellent and stupid like the one that appears on the screen, go, rather than talk seems haranguing what says, and more that fall nice, one wishes to remove the shoe and give it a good beating of cheeks, by weighs.Can not forget me not of baby (great in his role do will return to delight us with another disk as the excellent "Pa out cobwebs"?), by the way, how much lost that girl without clothes, on the other hand is Irene Jacob, which is difficult to understand a Word when he opens his mouth, although curiously his "son" if he speaks the language of Cervantes.Tal time, what I least liked of this film that is round in his career is the finalso diffuse, so little concise, in which one can (or must) imagine what would like to to it occur.</body>
