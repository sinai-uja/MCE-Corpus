	<body>Some friends who meet daily in a Hall of slot machines to play a dance game, are forced to participate in an international competition of the game by getting into a mess with a few Legionnaires. The film starts a mode so appealing, but will gradually falling into easy clichés of the genre, to constitute a script made blatantly with template and holds few surprises. Even so, so funny and friendly tone that has given Oscar Aibar, as well as numerous references to films, which homage, Karate Kid or Rambo the most obvious, is that "La machine de Bailar" becomes a nice title and with some interest.In the distribution, highlight Jordi Vilches, conditioned by his physical to the same role of pringadete that we have seen in many movies, but that shows that he has talent, and chameleonic Santiago Segura with the hair to the afro and sheathed in a suit drive, worthy of the Soul Train in the 1970s. As says rake, photography is very good, something with double merit that is usually only notice that paragraph when the film is boring.Nice and entertaining, "La machine de dance" has the freshness of the film laughing if same, conscious of its few claims and quality. Get as far as aim, and nor is it reasonable to ask for much more.</body>
