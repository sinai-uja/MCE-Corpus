	<body>The photographer of the panic and psychosis inciaron the genre, at least according to the documentary Going to pieces, very entertaining but a tad empty, because of what they are chiefly is to praise a genus that has given us glorious moments: Halloween, Viernes13, burning, Prom night, My bloody Valentine, Camp Blood. the total slasher, with all the good and all the bad things you have; his classics with their exploiteds. Wes Craven, Rob Zombie, Sean S. Cunningham, journalists, critics and a young Roger Ebert putting the leg to the bottom (file, I guess that today fall you the face of shame to say the nonsense stated of the genre at the time) are some of the witnesses of the rise and fall of the slasher.It is entertaining, but as you have not seen any of the movies you are screwed, because it is a documentary filmed based on spoilers.Approved by nostalgia and recover some huge point, but they could have a little careful above all on the part of Catholic protests and censorship. For the nostalgic.</body>
