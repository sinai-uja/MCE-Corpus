	<body>With this movie I enjoyed by the time did it not. For time since I spent by a film and I wanted to see something fun that get me away from the real world if only for awhile. From seeing this movie even knowing that some of my colleagues not had liked at all. Immediately, I fell in love with, so direct and raw be filmed this movie is such that not only impress with images but it also impacts with a dialog added formidably realistic (at least before the first pivot point) that made me an accomplice of his Machiavellian and vengeful plot.The history is tour environment to "boy meets girl" (via internet) are to take an ice cream and spend a nice time together. The problem is that "chico" is a photographer of 32 years and "girl" is a young woman of 15. At first the viewer assumes what will happen when "kid" decided to take home "girl" to do a photo shoot. But as an as predictable script could do with Sitges award? very easy, because this story will not this stick, here the innocent "girl" it turns a vengeful soul that waited to be home of the photographer to make you suffer in ways unexpected to find out if this has any relationship with a case of paedophilia that been in the area recently.In my view is a quite original film both approach and approach to the public to which it is not stupid like the majority of American films of recent times. It is very radical in its approach, which reinforces that mystery that envelops the young protagonist in a mantle that it avoids to see if it is a righteous or a psychopath without scruples. In this film there is no good deeds, just some less evil than others.</body>
