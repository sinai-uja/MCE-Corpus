	<summary>A simple comedieta of fast, linear consumption nauseam that does nothing, but that we are pushed, who do not know very well why strange inner strength.</summary>
	<body>I have a special setting for this type of film, I can not, I know in advance that it will be a shit movie, that I will end up hating and that in every minute of projection I'll be cursing out left and right each and every one of the details of it, but however, a strange Goblin pushes me to watch her (and then criticize).As well, yet another advance to the "Buddy Movies" so booming in the first half of the 1990s and had its maximum splendor in films such as the "Lethal weapon", "Colleagues to force" series and even, and although to a lesser extent "Beverly Hills COP in Hollywood", now, all living a second youth have Samuel L.Jackson making the role of always, and to Eugene Levy, idem of the same, this insults comedieta, which lasts some righteous 83 min. and that view, be m√°sca and digested nearly as Levy character on screen, digestion is perhaps less important, given the simplicity of the same.The greater incentive is a soundtrack that never ceases to amaze, and the participation of English actor Luke Goss, famous at the time for the musical duo Bross which have now moved to action cinema (le souvenir "Blade II", for example as a vampire).Anyway, in short, that little more can be added, a simple comedieta of fast, linear consumption nauseam that adds nothing, but that which we pushed, is not known very well because strange power within, leaves little to say nothing to the imagination. Even the jokes are basic!</body>
