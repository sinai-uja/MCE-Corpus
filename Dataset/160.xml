	<summary>It is one of the most silly films I've seen in my life</summary>
	<body>Titled in English as "Is not another teen movie of love", is definitely one of the most silly films I've seen in my life. In English is called Date Movie is "movie for a date" and your letter of presentation have been created by "two of six creators of Scary Movie". Calculate the nivel.Â¿Por what a refined spectator as moi ended in the cinema watching this kind of "Laughter and sauce" gringo? Precisely because not all films that my "date" had not seen I already had seen them and vice versa. We only in common had not seen this movie, for obvious reasons of common sense. But, what the hell! Why not let rest neurons awhile and relax with the parody all romantic movies made in Hollywood?I must admit that I laughed enough that the producers of this film chicha forgave not a single movie of love, but I also suffered arcades of disgust in several parts. And that came from see hostel yesterday and have good stomach. There were two or three scenes in which I had to plug me the eyes of truth.I am not going to say that I was disappointed, because the film turned out to be exactly what I expected. Instead to my "date", which is actually one of my "best friends", yes I saw a little more disillusioned. "Not I thought it was so bad", told me at the end. Go, please go with confidence and friends plan "will do something stupid". Not one happens them go with a true romantic date. And step are preparing themselves, that already comes Scary Movie 4!</body>
