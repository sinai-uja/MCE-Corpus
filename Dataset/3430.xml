	<body>Narrated by Constantine Romero (in our version), "the film of our planet Earth" shows us problems and avatars that have to suffer the animals to survive.Despite the fact that they show us more races, the protagonists of this story are three: a polar bear, a pair of humpback whales and elephants.Obviously, there is an entity which takes the leading role, and is none other than our planet, which he gradually loses its ability to give us and provide us with life, and through this collection of hours of material, we can appreciate how it affects and affect the inhabitants of this beautiful (and little care) environment.Nature is often cruel, and part of this law of life for us is shown in this documentary, it has amazing and astonishing beauty, that deserve to be seen on the big screen and not on television.However, the footage is a little heavy at certain times. In short, "Earth" is presented as an option very interesting and different to where they usually have in the halls, and that deserves to be seen by the excellent work of recording, for extreme situations, by delight with wonderful prints, see the suffered lives of some animals, and raising a little of what is happening around us.</body>
