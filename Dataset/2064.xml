	<summary>Killed with Bill Murray watching to infinity or driving times can be extremely boring, but they have the function of transmitting the passage of time and the banal existence.</summary>
	<body>Broken flowers is a comedy that does not cause laughter, with a subtle and ironic humor, the style of its protagonist, Bill Murray, just sitting and staring at the empty already conveys it sad that his life is and how bad that is let to pass the time without doing anything. It isn't an actor with great versatility, has at least not shown, always makes the same kind of characters, but is his style and is unmatched, making people laugh without doing absolutely nothing.Killed with Bill Murray watching to infinity or driving times can be extremely boring, but they have the function to convey the passage of time and the banal existence, but abused these moments with a music not accompanied by the more accurate way.Actresses come soon, because the absolute protagonist is Bill Murray, but are fine, Sharon Stone, Jessica Lange and Julie Delpy are some of those women taking part (or part) of the life of the protagonist and the truth is hard to believe that this man is a "Don Juan" and conquer all these women with its charm, because it does not have.What is clear is that those who like Bill Murray movie will love, and which not him endure better that they see not.</body>
