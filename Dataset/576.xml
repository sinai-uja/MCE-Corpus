	<summary>Incomprehensible rolls of honour, impossible amorios and codes of assassins. There are dead and action, but very soft and flavored talks to kill boredom.</summary>
	<body>The honour in Japan is the host, and makes that much shock in Western culture. For example, if your shit it at work, quickly looking for thousand excuses before acknowledge the error, pataleas, insult, biting, throw you the blame to another, etc. There are able to commit suicide by mistake, by washing his image and his honor, as well as his family. In Spain the politicians could do that right? By the way, this had a prequel game arcade, of remarkable success, despite how difficult that was.The film is about Romeos and Julietas are two different villages that are not too well in Japanese. For the amusement of the Emperor, the King or Chief of not is what, they have to take their five best warriors and kill each other. So coincidentally by each side one of the members is one of the lovers (Teruel, silly it, fool him). And come to jump until make only one standing.With this argument we imagine a movie action, flying Japs and things as well. Much to my regret I tell you that no, that the movie is incomprehensible rolls of honour, impossible amorios and codes of assassins. There are dead and action, but very soft and flavored talks to kill boredom. And then there's nothing of chicha, things are going very linear and the end scares of gilipollesco that is. By the way, it reminded me to another movie of the genus, now I do not remember which was.To sum up, roll, rollae, that decline in Latin.</body>
