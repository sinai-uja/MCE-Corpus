	<summary>Sincere designed comic so early on in which Tomei character looking for that dream "Damon Bradley", we also have curiosity to know and expect it to be so ideal for her as it thinks that it can be.</summary>
	<body>This week that, for the gigs, I sleep when the hens, my wife is using to see this kind of film which I only do not gives me hives, but which also bores me as an Oyster; Perhaps, I have to admit with a certain amount of shame that this, like some other film more, are few tapes but not get to love me, I like somehow, and it is that, although the argument is always, there are certain doses of originality, as well as a Marisa Tomei and Robert Downey Jr in a permanent state of grace.The tape, one of those movies of desktop that you can find in any television channel shift, is a sincere devised so that from the beginning in which Tomei character looking for that dream "Damon Bradley", we also have curious to know and expect it to be so ideal for her as it thinks that it can be.On the other hand, the staff side is quite "curiosete" (change to Nice), from Billy Zane, rather than stay as bald as a server, Bonnie Hunt, sister or mother of exception in countless feature films, and the Portuguese Joaquim de Almeida, in the era (talk about a tape dated 13 years ago) in which both Almeida and many other Portuguese actors crossed the pond with direction to the States.En end, it hurts to admit with some embarrassment, but I like and I don't mind to see it wherever it falls at home DVD.</body>
