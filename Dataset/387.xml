	<body>When the film ends one stays silent, crestfallen and pensive, while the melt in black that ends the film by Paul Greengrass, seems to penetrate up to your temples, and is that the 11-S fatidico of the year 2001 change something for everyone, and as I read out there, all lost something, (as lost in my city the 11-M).The film mixes with master a drama, a thriller and a documentary, shaken and not blended, as said James Bond; Greengrass composed a tape where we see the characters not as heroes, but like any normal person, indeed, like one of us in that position; It makes us also us feel part of that flight, which suffer with what you feel in the air control, or decisions that were carried out that day.The actors, all unknown, in fact many of them are interpreted to themselves (go, are the "protagonists" of what happened), a script with scraps of history and much improvisation, and a history that, even knowing the end keeps you glued to the seat, a tape anthology, essential and who gets what he wants, without a doubt, delve into the consciousness of the Viewer.The silence of the patio of armchairs so made it clear.</body>
