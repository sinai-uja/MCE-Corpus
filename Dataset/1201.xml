	<body>Again have Gibson contándo on screen a story of redemption, the truth is that I do not understand this man, this mania for films in languages there is no who understood, but in the end, the remains, and we see them and want to understand something on screen, blessed subtitles.We must thank him at least a picture perfect, full of beautiful landscapes, and a simple story, too much for my taste, again, full of emotive moments (as in his previous film) that hardly can delete from our retina, a linear argument, calling for action, adventure and entertainment.More than one controversy to avivado the hardness of its images, some camera in hand to give an air of reality documentary, accompanied by a soundtrack that infests Aztec rhythms (that tube sound ringing over and over again).He did not want to end without highlighting the resemblance of the protagonist with some Brazilian Star of the Barça. Anyway, he expected less and I've seen more, I don't know, it doesn't disappoint and performs, cannot be said more.</body>
