	<summary>It is nothing more than the Christmas story, Dickens, where you change the morals of a man discovering his past, his present and his future, only this time, instead of ghosts, spirits or ghosts, we have a remote control.</summary>
	<body>The only apparent originality is the plot excuse: a man (Adam Sandler) wretched, bored of his life and his family discovers how can change your life through an as common as a command object at distance, whose typical functions (do stop, lower the volume, change chapter, etc?) magically apply to your environment. Everything else is already seen; the story is nothing more than the Christmas story, Dickens, where you change the morals of a man discovering his past, his present and his future, only this time, instead of ghosts, spirits or ghosts, have a remote control at distance and the character of Christopher Walken. What happens is that nothing here fit or make sense, and also comedy absurd with the typical conservative American label to preserve the family above all.After five minutes of projection we have already forgotten history and dedicate ourselves to find thanks to jokes, which looks at your where, have them. It will be because the humor presented to us is not so white as we expect in an argument of such moralina, and sexual and eschatological references and swearing, without reaching the levels of the Farrelli, of course, are quite present.Avoid it if you can, but if see, only laugh and not think.</body>
