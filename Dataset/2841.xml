	<summary>At the end of a strange feeling of coldness crosses the body of the Viewer.</summary>
	<body>Once completed the movie have been walking through the network in search of opinions and is that when this has just one stays cold, cone, who does not know to say and do not know where start, it is true that it is very well shot and that transmits (little, the truth), Nicolas Cage is in his typical role as always and that both Jared Letto (which I remember as the "Panic room" of Fincher Raoul) and Bridget Moynahan "women vase" in a role intended for Monica Bellucci, ah! Ethan Hawke I forgot, but it is coming out so little that it is normal that one forget completely of him.With screenplay and direction by Andrew Nicoll (the author of the script for "The truman show" "S1M0NE" and "The terminal") that the truth is that I quite like it, the film is "something sosita".</body>
