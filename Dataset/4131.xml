	<summary>A new success of Paul Haggis and van...</summary>
	<body>From what he had heard about this movie, I stayed with the phrase that was much more critical with the war of Iraq to Lions for Lambs, tape that excited me by his critical truthful and voracious, towards the involvement of the Iraq war United States. And he did not think that a successor could overcome it.And the truth is that I still have that impression. In the Valley of Elah tells desperate struggles of a father to find his son that are mysteriously missing. Then, the messages offered to the viewer are: the feeling that have many parents, especially those who have belonged to the army as the protagonist, know perfectly to their children and the less predictable impact of young soldiers that they come from a war so hard as it may be Bosnia or Irak.Ese kind of messages are not critical of the American performancerather they reflect a situation occurs in which not even notice and that the great Paul Haggis has been able to display perfectly in the film, after reading in a newspaper article the real story told in the film. But obviously I'll take criticism of Redford in Lions for Lambs, ironic and have managed to show from three different points of vbista.In this, we are a great story told with the mastery of this writer that never ceases to surprise us, some magnificent performances, only reflected at the Oscars for the nomination of Tommy Lee Jones, but that is perfectly accompanied by this great actress so versatile is Charlize Theron, which I keep admiring, and not least for those few minutes but of great artistic quality, of the always unique Susan Sarandon.</body>
