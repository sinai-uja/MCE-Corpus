Is why this film of moans and silences, of truths to mezza voce, of stories that collide (as the toy trenecitos) and fragments that are reflected on the other (the police in the exhibitionist and this in turn in the lovers), is the example of as the cluster of our mistakes ends suffering it who less blame.
