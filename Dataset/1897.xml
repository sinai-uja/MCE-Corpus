	<body>I admire Michael Winterbottom, I loved "Code 46" film that not yet premiered in Spain, however, when I saw this movie that barely lasts an hour and ten minutes. I felt quite disappointed, I think the last time I stayed with this face was watching "Ken Park", more than anything explicit sex and that the film is nothing more than a couple fucking and a few performances of through.It is true that it was clear what he was going to see (more or less) but I could imagine some history, some of chicha and not a mere porn movie hidden behind several scenes of concerts.In short, boring, tedious and rather tired.</body>
