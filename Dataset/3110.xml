	<summary>Don't miss the opportunity of entering in a world far although family through a film that is based on the particular anecdote and anticipated us the stark reality.</summary>
	<body>New York is what we see, but it is very different to which we are accustomed: the city of opportunities is shown distinctively immigrant, clean resources, and through four outstanding performances, torn and very hard.Interesting thing about this unusual production which do not have more than his work to survive in a hostile world is both the form and the Fund. The shortcomings of an opera prima are usually cover with a good approach, an Honorable achievement and a finish that meets expectations.The debut of Christopher Zalla passes these three assessments and passing the final exam with note because it does not fall in the pretentious nor in the foreseeable. After going down to hell more than one decides to stay between the IMPS even having the opportunity to hold on to the hand of an Angel. After this phrase and bearing in mind the obvious religious of the title, may think that we are encouraging the path of the good Christian.It is not, we intend only to want to continue a way, Yes, but by which we guide this newcomer, an itinerary that runs with logic and surprises that enrich the journey. An example can be found in the search for the father: has weight that desire meet with the parent because of the importance of this figure in a child's education (and hence also enter the dreams of which leaves the Mexican city of Puebla), but not here lies all the weight of the footage.We will not have anything about the plot, it is worth taking the point of view of the trio of young protagonists and entering in New York overnight, in the other, which we do not see with our own eyes.</body>
