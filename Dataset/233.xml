	<summary>Another film which is announced as a faithful reflection of the life of a writer of so-called? damned?, and is half way.</summary>
	<body>Too politically correct. One expects to find with syphilis, drunkenness, and anthologies fights in bars, and well, there is a bit of everything, but very decaffeinated. The film is not entirely bad, though it is a bit slow. The best, Matt Dillon.Vuelve to occur. And they are two in a month. Another film Announces as a faithful reflection of the life of a writer of the so called "cursed", and who stays in the medium on the way. On this occasion it's adapted to the screen, a free version of the life of Charles Bukowsky, so free that in fact, change you the name. An allegation of personal improvement of the social corsets, a reflection of the bronco and Bohemian world is more that emerged the best pages of Bukowsky. They try not to glorify the figure of the eternal loser, but simply to portray it with pastel colors. There are so many beautiful people, in my view, also subtracts claw to the environments you want to represent. Anyway, it is pretty good, and there are moments of pathos reaching thrill the Viewer. Another feature that takes interest in the movie are horrendous sentences in voice-over, that they resemble the worst without city, trying to seem very profound and poetic, but they sound like joke. In conclusion, American independent cinema and this already seems worryingly endemic in many of this "genus", with more than TV Antena 3 that of cinema made with boldness and desire to provoke.</body>
