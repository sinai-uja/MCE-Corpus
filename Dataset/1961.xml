	<body>Absolutely blown away I left when alla by year 1987 discovered the visual wonder of Paul Verhoeven truth is when it was "nano" if I wondered were my favorite movies you answered without thinking twice that "Batman" from Tim Burton (another great visual jewel) and the first film by Verhoeven and now that taking advantage of than the Robocop trilogy has fallen into my hands the trilogy on DVD have chosen the first installment (la) (best of all) to watch again. Say that perhaps no me has excited as I was thrilled at the time, although there are phrases that I know from memory of the tape as "there is a new type in the city, is called Robocop" or almost at the end of the film when he faces "the bad" and says "do I wanted?" Hehe, that flipe! Great interpretations of Peter Weller and Nancy Allen on the other hand would continue in the saga as companion of Murphy (aka Robocop) however only Weller made the first of the films, and was then replaced, although I always you I've seen somewhere that another film not have been able to I forget this role that marked my childhood. The main theme of the film is also one authentic past, and although the film is repeated endlessly (perhaps that is) fails to empalagar at any time an almost epic melody that excellently accompanies the action of the film by Paul Verhoeven.</body>
