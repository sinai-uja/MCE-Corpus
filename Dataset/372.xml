	<body>The Spielberg film represents just the opposite that the Greengrass. Spielberg authored much easier to praise because it leaves its mark on everything it touches. Its vocation is to manipulate. When speaking of Jews makes it clear his political message, and when speaking of dolls who speak or immigrants her√≥icos you know any excuse is valid to provoke an emotion.There are who admires this type of copyright because it makes a difficult job. This type of Viewer may not appreciate what makes Greengrass. Its work is reduced to strip a few facts of any rhetorical element of everything that can affect us. The style of the film is thoroughly behaviorist, we know nothing of any character except what he said or what he did at the time of the accident. The Viewer is free to sympathize with terrorists or with the flight attendants. Everything you see are made.Nobody is going to go see "United 93" without knowing the end. The movie doesn't play with the possible outcomes, but full of uneasiness when it tells the amount of incidents that could have aborted the plot.Although it seems a neglected film has a profound work. The author has chosen a space of time in which things could have changed. You have chosen a camera on his shoulder that moves as a look. You have chosen voices and characters that don't behave to rise to the occasion because none knows that he is taking part in a historic moment. The heroes do not have time to do great phrases, drivers do not know where are the aircraft although you can see burn the towers with their eyes. The only one who knows too much is the Viewer.</body>
