	<summary>A great dose of Surrealism full of reality. One of those gems that is worth going to the cinema.</summary>
	<body>Jason Reitman will enter into my list of favorite directors for their ease of make surreal things may seem more real.This is Juno, the story of a very particular teenager, to be so young with very clear focus on his life, when it gives a tremendous turnaround staying pregnant. His personality and that decision are very little credible, as well as the environment that surrounds it, but Reitman gets with a few dialogues divertidisimos and some very extreme situations but that carried with an incredible genius, you think that these problems and these people can actually exist in our daily lives.Juno is also a breath of fresh air to a cinema that entretetiene and excited at the same time, without resorting to the same topics. If to this we add, magnificent interpretations both Ellen Page, Allison Janey, J.K Simmons and Jennifer Garner, because history is much more fun and appealing to the Viewer.Ivan Reitman is characterized by caricaturing hypocrisy that we in reality, first with the wonderful thank you for smoking and now with Juno, and also characterized by characters with a strong personality are surrounded by other characters that accompany the perfection to tell these stories.I don't think that I will be nothing at the next Oscars because it isn't a drama independent film, if her had he done so, perhaps it is would but it would not reach a quality Reitman, so I prefer not it take him, and surprised us with films like this.</body>
