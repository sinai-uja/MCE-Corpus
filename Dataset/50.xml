	<summary>Very good to convince you that you should not ever entering a psychiatric</summary>
	<body>Why have given eyes so red the Lord of the poster? That fear. The film is a man who has died twice. The first time in the Gulf war and the second in a strange case with a police officer while hitchhiking toward. Total, as he does not die at all, falls a little crazy by him he admitted in a psychiatric hospital. The doctor dealing with him must be cousin of Menguele, given his therapy consists of drugging him, tying him with a straitjacket and put him in an archive in the basement. Then remove you and so has to be cured. Raaaarrroooo, raaaarooooo.¿Que you want tell you? As you you have left brain at home, or you occurs enter, this is thinking. To my me bored sovereignty, given that history not hooked until near the end. The script is not bad in everything, but the truth that does not kill. The actors curran it much, and do very well, but you spend throughout the film thinking of that's happening?. And that is the problem, that you do not understand why was recorded this film. Do not know if it is a criticism of the war, criminals, the psychiatric or what. And if laugh, because you still entenderías, but it is a kind of very strange love drama. Already at the end improves, and makes a curious approach to travel to the future, which saves the rest of the footage.In short, if they make a movie about travel to the future with this idea, you can get something good. Of course, this is not the best way of telling a story. And if wanted that we angustiasemos, what they have achieved, I spent the entire film looking at the clock to see what was left.</body>
