	<body>Gregory Wilson practically debuts in the direction since his previous film HOME INVADERS was an amateur action.This feeds a group of children starting their careers and two veterans of the television in the presences of BLANCHE BAKER view in the series law &amp; order and GRANT SHOW that starred culebron MELROS PLACE.Cast alongside director do not have a too endorsed curriculum, in addition to a synopsis that seems to sell the typical film of horror based on real facts on the pretext of showing a repertoire of atrocities for a demanding GOURMET of extreme GORE.Definitely it is not what he wants the author away totally from clichés in one of the most brilliant films of the year.Set in the 1960s seamlessly in an impeccable reconstruction of the era that you practically dives from the foreground in the recesses and customs of all the characters.The film is clearly divided into two acts: an act I like all these stories of the birth of love in adolescence where already are can view between the youth loves evil characters that give the succession to the terrible events that will bring the second Act. An act which raised the foundations is to teach a final part that leaves you breathless before the collection of torture a woman sick helped their children's Orchestra against a young innocent.It grips you hatred, frustration to observe human cruelty shown without conceptions to the Gallery, crying click you the chest for the realism of cash with a force little seen in the current film.Without a drop of GORE, therefore is not important when an author of enormous talent as demonstrated by WILSON wants to show something truthful, not simply leverages the screenplay for the easy curiosity raises some terrible facts harshly they require.Technically perfect in everything.</body>
