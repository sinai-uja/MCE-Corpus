	<body>In front of me, six of thirteen children fight over a bucket of popcorn while the music sounds at full blast the song one of the start. Insurance that when our parents saw "Dirty Harry" this did not happen.And it is that "16calles", the penultimate film by Richard Donner (has announced "Sam & George"), he is one of those classic Street films, the Eastwood, although belongs to the "new thriller Street", as "Last call".By the way, should be respected qualifications by age of the movies, to avoid the muchachada palomitera; If the movie is for 13 or older and you have 13, do not enter, son of a bitch. Eight in the morning are past, and Jack Mosley has to present in court before ten, Eddie Bunker.El corrupt police force will try to avoid it.
