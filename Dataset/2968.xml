	<body>Very interesting proposal by Stephen Frears on how he lived the tragedy of the death of Lady Diana of Wales Queen Elizabeth II of England, along with his family, and the newly elected by then Prime Minister Tony Blair.La address is very correct and elegant with a hint of brilliance, which knows very well to maintain the type during the hour and a half and little more than hard film. The cast is great from beginning to end, emphasizing on above all Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II: one of the best roles of his career and one of the most interesting and remarkable of the year performances.However, becomes a tad long and pesadita, and can it not connect at all with some viewers.</body>
