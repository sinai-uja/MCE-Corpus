	<summary>Do assume?V for Vendetta? as an anarchist, it is little more than surprising</summary>
	<body>I just found out the interesting action perpetrated by the collective of workers cultural La Felguera. 12 April last, during the screening of the film "V for Vendetta". Activists of the anarchist movement, took advantage of the distraction of Madrid Ideal theaters security guards and held the action of replacing the information leaflets of the film, which under a purely movie buff background, explained the plot of the play, as well as references and inspirations of this in other films by others that the collective had been made respecting the same format but where the text had changedadapting it to instruct the absent-minded spectator of the work to which approached watch.Assume "V for Vendetta" as an anarchist work, is little more than surprising, even more if we take into account that it is designed as the work of a multinational that only to enrich themselves using any kind of pretext, while he gets his hand in his pockets to a few spectators left in the ignominy. Reproduce them a fragment of the enlightening text made by the collective: "." Everyone frantically seeks his style and his identity and the false belief in this alleged return to the inner life and nature (soy, zen, culture East.) when what is to more and better new products of consumption because the market transforms and adapts each time more quickly to new conditions. "Today, the rebellion is another form of consumption and"V for Vendetta"is of course, and also the result of this equation."Do not forget to come to the page of the collective, where you will find many more desveladores data regarding this and many other issues, part of the original synopsis to download in .pdf format and the suplantada by the collective.</body>
