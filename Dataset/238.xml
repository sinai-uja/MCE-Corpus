	<summary>DreamWorks, the House created by Spielberg is making step by step a site in the complicated world of digital animation</summary>
	<body>Not only Pixar dominates the cinema of animation, there have to Dreamworks, the House created by Spielberg is doing step by step somewhere in the complicated world of digital animation, and if already with "Shrek" achieved what more than one intended (that funny "touch" of tales classics.), now with "neighbouring invaders" get that tape "animals" originally aimed for children ends in an excellent comedy for all ages, the adult people who occupied the room when I saw the film could not stop laughing and is not for less, Hammy, voiced by Eduard "Neng" Soto (nothing to do with his normal voice), is perhaps the most sympathetic character throughout the film.The animation quite achieved (perhaps in the human characters weakens a bit.), the fur of animals, the skin of the turtle, everything is almost real, 10 to Dreamworks for 3 years (almost) working. Finally, removes you bias thinking that it is a tape for "kids" that her you are going to enjoy all.</body>
