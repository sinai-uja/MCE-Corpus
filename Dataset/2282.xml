	<summary>A palpable demonstration that with ingenuity and good taste, may be in a playful manner any matter by delicate to be.</summary>
	<body>While the comedy it it has never been the genre more me has pleased, except for specific exceptions, red phone. We flew to Moscow has been one of the films that most impressed me, in an extremely pleasant way. Surreal, absurd, and humor above all based on the trivialization of a problem that in that historical context atenazaba the world, kept me embedded during the footage of this superb comedy of Stanley Kubrick. basically, the argument is based on paranoia Soviet anti of an American general, which takes you to order a nuclear attack on Moscow without consulting with anyone. Quickly, the Government gets underway to try to prevent the Holocaust.The ridicule of the military, appearing as remaining bellicose, and simplification and minimization of the figure of politicians before they reach glorious points in scenes starring a vehement George C. Scott, who gives great dynamism to the brilliant dialogues that make up the different scenes.A fun, entertaining and extremely ingenious way of dealing with a subject as sensitive as the cold war, that many times was about to take the world to the disaster.</body>
