	<summary>A pestiño that in his time should serve to refine more than one unrepentant jamaipanese zambomba. This not the saved nor Esteso in his best seasons.</summary>
	<body>The lofts of the Costa del Sol spend, but of time there where catch them. My Maaaaadre.The film is a girl who is the heir to a wealthy landowner (Ozores) who dies under mysterious circumstances. When you receive the inheritance to the luxurious mansion of his uncle (the dead landlord) service makes life impossible, given who want to keep them the lion's share. And there appears a notary intern (or something, I learned well) is nothing more and nothing less than Pajares, which is responsible to tell you that it has fallen. But the thing is entangled and leaving many pubic hairs, breasts and fondling impudent.Bad, bad, bad, but bad, bad, bad. Is there where catch her, given that doesn't make much sense nothing in the film. It is saved, as always, the performance of Ozores which kills me laughing. Pajares makes it always, but dressed in time. Adorn the film a couple of girls in porretas, who wear medium liguero each and have the key to the treasure. Funny political jokes, the style of "Escaped in disguise, as Carrillo" and many similar are.In short, a pestiño that in his time should serve to refine more than one unrepentant jamaipanese zambomba. This not the saved nor Esteso in his best seasons.Besitos.P.D: The inclusion of a man gay Wolf is the most ludicrous of the history of dandruff.</body>
