	<body>Entertaining movie and prequel of cube, where either by remotely approaching the quality of l °, but it has seemed better than the 2nd. Very few things we clarify on the cube, but we have an idea of because they are the chosen people cube (not all). I think that it's the chip in the head of the soldiers have left. At least can take the same environment that the first part (is that the second is so bad). In fact there are moments where I felt quite identified with the film (which I also work of operator) and see "operators of the cube" has made me see things I usually do in my job quite often. If you like Cube think you spend a fun with this time. It has an ending that could be a loop with the first part.</body>
