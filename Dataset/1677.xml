	<body>His short film 15 days, an interesting account of a "survivor" of modern society, was a good range and a very elaborate letter for the next step: the film. However, for all those with this short film we knew and we also admire other directors, this debut has become disappointing.Circus Martín Martín (own by Medem names game), is the largest prize winner in a game show. However this stroke of luck will turn against him in the most unexpected way.A premise as this could give much game. However, Rodrigo Cortes, who seems delighted to have been known, us tide and fool with a varied but not excessively original visual style.All those who appreciate the work and style of Tony Scott and Oliver Stone can be seen in this film his long shadow: Assembly, mixture of image styles (from effects for film 8 mm up to animated pictures through chained) and verbiage that, in this case, does not define the character and takes forward the story. Ah! History, of course. Because although the history can be summarized briefly, what more doubts I causes of this film is the message that the director and screenwriter wants to give: do we live in a society of penpusher? is having a stroke of luck bad? is being rich a curse? There is way to change nothing of what surrounds us no? I think that one of the questions only has an easy answer.Seeing the end of the film gives the impression of you want to have a drama with comedic moments. You want to do cry by a character that we do not know whether it is avaricioso or simply Economist.In short, a film which aims to give a masterful lesson in how screwed we are in capitalism but with a protagonist (Sbaraglia) who can not take it.</body>
