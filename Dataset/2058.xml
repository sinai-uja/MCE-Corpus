	<summary>A crude attempt to play the chord of the viewer using topics and arguments of an endiosado fool</summary>
	<body>The Camino de los ingleses is one of those movies that is called copyright, supposed that they transcend the purely aesthetic to attempt to explore the people inside and do emerge feelings that invite reflection. I have nothing against it.But if the product is a repellent petulance and an absolute lack of style that seeks only the self at the expense of ridicule somehow girl home and portray her in an insulting manner, then that Director bothers me. I am Andalusian and I can assure anyone that the social portrait that Banderas intends to do does not match what was or is Andalusia, and that this alleged sensitivity which tries to convey is that, a simple pretentious attempt of a man that constantly needs to demonstrate that it complies with all the stereotypes expected of a celebrity that combines the luxury and successful life with left-wing ideals that generally only remember with advertising campaign paid for by the Junta de Andaluc√≠a of medium.Although it is not my intention to judge him as a person, that among other things, I have nothing against him, but it bothers me that it is used in a crude manner the feel of a quite punished people already by hurtful stereotypes. If above becomes a slow, dull chestnut and at times grotesque, even worse.I expected more of all the senses, as director and Andalusian flags. Although if you look at his career, nor should be surprised that the result has been this monstrosity.</body>
