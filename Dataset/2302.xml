	<summary>New test in the direction of David S. Goyer which after the disaster of Blade Trinity, seems to have improved a bit, but even he has left much way to make a good movie.</summary>
	<body>Nick is a misunderstood guy who wants to flee to London to study a writing course and Annie is the girl problems of the Institute. Both will have an encounter because of the friend of Nick that owes money to the girl. After this the girl going to believe that Nick is guilty of accuse, to denounce the police which will be to go after and accidentally end up killing him. But Nick will return as a ghost and the girl seems to be the only one who can perceive, but this really just not made very clear in the film.New test in the direction of David S. Goyer which after the disaster of Blade Trinity, seems to have improved a bit, but even he has left much way to make a movie good, something worrying considering that his next project is the spinoff of Magneto. The film manages to have a very interesting presentation of characters and at the beginning of become the boy Ghost is something quite well reflected. But reaches a point in which the sequences they become cansinas and when it enters game the girl and his repentance, and the strange link established between the two just did not materialize.While Goyer moves away from the aesthetic videoclipera in this film, still much abusing put songs during all the footage and practically every five minutes, where, among others, are groups such as Death Cab For Cutie, Broken Social Scene, Snow Patrol, or A Perfect Circle. The film stays in a lost opportunity to go further and offer something that come out of the topics and ends up being a product that serves only to pass the time and that if we are not very pretentious.</body>
