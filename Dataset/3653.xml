	<body>Brian De Palma tilting against the American army in "Redacted" (2007) showing us how soldiers violate a minor and the kill she and her family sausages in alcohol and drugs. The intention of De Palma denounce those facts although formally me disappointed seems laudable. Palm uses forms of the documentary fiction or mockumentary with domestic recordings of own soldiers, footage from security cameras, videos posted on internet or images from webcams. And I repeat, if the intention seems laudable (is the author of the script) the result seems false and impostado. Never over the footage I believe what I see, I always seem to actors performing, situations and dialogue already seen and heard.Film has successes as the use of the images hanging on Iraqi sites and some creative use of the domestic recordings as at the level autograba the latino soldier placing the fixed camera and spoke with his mother, stops a car behind him, they kidnap him, the level stays empty until that appears the soldier partner is amazed that this camera recording and turned her off.The film has generally received with applause (in addition to prize in Venice) by critics and it seems to me that the applause deserves them De Palma for their courage and commitment with its project rather than by its strict cinematic merits paying clumsily (in my opinion) to the formal path of cinema of complaint shown by the far superior "In This World" and "Road to Guantanamo".On the other hand find me it shameful that the producers of the film will decide unilaterally and against the wishes of its maximum author placing some unnecessary black stripes over the eyes of the victims appearing in real pictures that closes the film. A horror.</body>
