	<summary>A great occasion to accompany the "kids" from home to film, with a story that will like them both to us.</summary>
	<body>Aardman, experts in ocher and clay animation film, are passed to the film in 3D, for deléite of large and small, with this film, debt of others such as the excellent "curse of the vegetables" of Wallace and Gromit (which appear here in two cameos), and "Chicken Run - evasion on the farm", which saves some parallelism, the truth is that the tape WINS integers in original versionabove all by the toad with the voice of Ian Mckellen, since both Rita (Hugh Jackman and Kate Winslet) and Rody give quite the same, perhaps of Andy Serkiss as one of the rats "cronies".It seems incredible that Aardman was able to translate 3D everything what already was in ocher, and is that the dolls do not differ at all that before did delight in his animated film, frankly, plated by them.If there is one point with which I prefer is with its excellent soundtrack, with its images of London in "ratuna" version, and with a storyline that never cease to move things, though perhaps that pace rampant sometimes pass bill to the film.A great occasion to accompany the "kids" from home to film, with a story that will like them both to us.</body>
