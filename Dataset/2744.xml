	<body>Entitled here crocodile: a serial killer, Primeval narrates the events (and still have) place in a remote location in Africa where there is a predator that has killed more than 300 lives. Dominic Purcell, descamisado prota of Prison Break also shines here his Tin chest, so I suppose that it is his idea. On this occasion he plays a reporter gañán in search of the bug. Accompany a girl, Orlando Jones (bet you your life to at least one joke is funny) and Jurgen Prochnow.El case is that at times the crocodile paints less than the monster of The Host and the movie is changing little by little in a political thriller and such, what happens is that it does not because it is boring as a working day on the day of the feast of the Virgin of the PalomaIt has no budget and is quite ridiculous, because if something is clear in this remake of the Anaconda is the crocodile thought and is smarter than the people who want him to hunt.Inspired by a real case. JAWS was better.</body>
