	<summary>Ideological and pamphleteering product to the delight of those who do not feel embarrassed.</summary>
	<body>There are films that want to do justice to a real event and dedicate his script and its efforts to overturn this.In the case before us is Apartheid and all the massacres and atrocities committed.The unknown, and I guess so I would because thus relates the film, is that when it ended what was offered amnesty to those murderers and torturers who confess his crime before their victims (or those who survived him). An attitude today today quite unthinkable but based on an attitude of forgiveness and for the achievement of peace. And an idea to transmit very interesting. But the film doesn't help at all.The director and the screenwriter make this film a product of embarrassment. There are two concepts to distinguish when carrying a real event to the screen. The fact may be real, but may be very little credible.And this is a perfect example (example: sequence of the child moved to the murderer of her parents). Precisely because trafficking in a political issue so geared that way and choose two protagonists as bastions of morality, decency and justice: two journalists (unfortunately fashionable today). One, Samuel l. Jackson, American (afro), racist and journalist from the Washington Post which passes fatal in USA and the other Juliette Binoche, native, but white, poet but activist and idealist to the core. Both are erected as the concerned actors to do justice "journalistically" covering the trials to the rest of the world.That Yes, both Jackson and Binoche and Brendan Gleeson are fine, but it is no use if the story does not endorse them. Ideological and pamphleteering product to the delight of those who do not feel embarrassed.</body>
