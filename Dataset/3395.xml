	<summary>A dramatic thriller that fortunately or unfortunately does not seem to be too close to any of the references that you would come to the head like Fincher, Hitchcock or Haneke. Interesting proposal of Rodrigo Plá, will have to keep track of.</summary>
	<body>I would have loved that my old criticism would be special, but time and hurry send, so it will be the penultimate movie of press that he witnessed via Muchocine the lucky. And they are many more. Thanks to the boss and greetings to my colleagues!Alejandro is a boy of sixteen years who lives in the area, a complex closed resdencial surrounded by a huge wall, self-sufficient and tough private security. The area is the last bastion of humanity, at least to the naked eye and the families that live there have been forced to do so because outside the crime and violence are growing alarmingly.A stormy night three criminals entering the zone &hellip; such an argument would give for a claustrophobic thriller to the Haneke, a refined kind Hitchcock suspense to a claustrophobic juggling to the Fincher.Por luck or unfortunately Rodrigo Plá, the director of this film premiered in Venice as best opera prima and with the prize of the international critics in Toronto is decided more by a violent drama about corruptionthe Division and hatred of a society increasingly broken.It is a hunting man and a harsh social criticism with many points in common with the masterpiece of Shyamalan, The Village última(por_el_momento). The cast highlights a splendid Daniel Giménez-Cacho as father of Alexander and one of the thinking heads of the Zona.Con an end too elongated prevents somehow appreciate all its hardness La zone is a curious exercise in style and renewal of the thriller worth viewing.</body>
