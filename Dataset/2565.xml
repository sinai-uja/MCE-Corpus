	<body>Spielberg said that you filming the film that you would like to see as a spectator, Tamahori, probably, you could say the same. What differentiates them is just that Tamahori is worst spectator.Nicholas Cage has a superpower that lets you know what will happen with two minutes in advance. It uses cover cheap Wizard's Hall, and occasionally gives a blow in a Las Vegas casino. The police seeks it to help them to prevent a catastrophe. He is looking for a girl who appeared in one of her premonitions. Its weak point is his humanity; It is not able to follow indifferent when it knows what will happen to someone else.The theme of the anticipation gives food for thought. One arises if the massacre of 11-M or 11-S could have been avoided with the advantage of two minutes. Perhaps a car accident. But we are not witnesses of many road accidents in life. Cage wants to meet the girl, approaching and she gives you long. So try to start another conversation. We discovered that the scene wasn't real; It was early, so you can fix it. A life with anticipations seems a virtual life, or Windows: all bugs can be repaired. There is no the blunders, the lapses, accidents or chance. Almost disappears entirely what one considered film.Police searching for Cage, which is logical, criminals also seek, and that bordering on abuse. Tamahori already had enough of our credulity with the history of the two minutes. It is not of Knights ask for more so we created criminals and also about that, if it's the girl, the magician anticipates so much in advance. Premonitions nor were needed to demonstrate that he liked the girl. They had to Jessica Biel.</body>
