	<body>This Sony Pictures film brings us the intimate story about the misadventures of a large Grizzly raised among humans, and a cooler deer rejected by all.The film tells of how very funny how important it is to take care of the friendship above all things. During the footage, we are finding a lot of funny scenes that made louder laughter from the mouths of our peque√±os.The pace of the movie is perfect, nor too overwhelming for the young minds of the public that is directed at, nor slow enough to make them lose interest in history. As for the bad, bad enough to know that it is, and ugly enough to identify it with the bad, without that scared too.The best carcajdas for adults will find them in discover until that point our small are able to react to the jokes that presents us with the history, the simple and comic suficientmente as so that they emerge having had a good laugh-filled time in the company of their parents.As it could not be otherwise he describes as: "It is which I liked most of all that I've seen so far", so we will give an excellent, because I believe that we have ousted the mythical "Madagascar".</body>
