	<summary>Documentary fake smart that shows the shames of the most powerful country in the world and how they react to different people.</summary>
	<body>Sometimes it happens that when it gets so well into a movie and creates so many expectations then you pass bill. This is what has happened with "Borat". It is true that not everyone has put her well, there are many parts that her branded as being anything but a film. The truth is that it is a false intelligent documentary that shows the shames of the most powerful country in the world and how they react to different persons and also when they laugh in their faces. Reporter Borat makes us a brief presentation of his country (Kazakhstan), including any gags showing us where you going to go the shots in what is left of footage, and informs us that he is going to go to the United States to do a story on the way of life and culture of this world power, to then be able to take it in their nation. Once it lands in America, begins the Carnival of this comic and showman that shows the various recesses of geography and American society. It has scenes and gags very witty and amusing, but as in all scales at the other end we have parties that either could have been eliminated or failing that best developed, lower level and can reach out to the Viewer.In short "Borat" occurs as a show where controversy, the transgression, the easy joke and even love are present and will spend a good time viewers with a sense of humor means and not away easily.</body>
