	<summary>Recommended for all those fans of youthful terror...</summary>
	<body>Teen-horror movie without searching many complications drinking from a thousand sources, from the original film (of which this is a remake) of Vincent Price, of which this picks up the name for the villain of the day, the film itself is another of the genre, where youngsters completely ostiables are falling into the hands of the murderer of the place. "Original" perhaps the way to die, and is now not the character of color the first to die.Paris Hilton and Elisha Cuthbert pretty well both wearing Palm and Paris making something of humor on "the reason why it is famous" (his famous video on the internet), anyway, that we should not ask del olmo pears (impressive Cuthbert's).Recommended for all those fans of youthful terror.</body>
