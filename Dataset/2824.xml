	<summary>This mix of genres not just marry at all and does that at times you you wonder if you are really suffering with the characters or you you are laughing with them.</summary>
	<body>Director Christopher Smith arrives to us is mixing surreal comedy and horror where a group of an arms company executives are invited to spend a weekend in what they hope is a luxurious Mansion at Romania. After being abandoned by the driver of the bus moving where they internaran in the forest with the idea of finding themselves the House, but they toparan with a group of paramilitary assassins.The film is intended to be a serious horror film, but at times it is interrupted by idiots more gags, that they do have his grace, but that break the rhythm and created tension. To my taste, this mix of genres not just marry at all and does that at times you you wonder if you are really suffering with the characters or you you are laughing with them. Some of the gags are actually achieved, especially when standing in the fridge, one of the most successful.</body>
