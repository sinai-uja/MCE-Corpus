	<body>Debut of GARY SHERMAN, who a few years later gave us the best film of ZOMBIES in film history with the devastating dead and buried. Pity that this magnificent director lost in television products or sequels in the infamous "3 POLSTERGUEIST".With two big stars of gender, Dr. LOOMIS unforgettable saga HALLOWEEN DONALD PLEASENCE and one of the best dráculas of the celluloid excellent Christopher LEE. One of these films that pass unnoticed at the time creating after school on subsequent ideas with very similar arguments, we have recent examples in CREEP or MAREBITO.Dirt characteristic of the era in which acute music of few notes with an exciting part where occurs the action counting as great reference scenarios grim and closed, highlighting an excellent address at times violence peaks was filmed with the grainy photograph is distilled. Bellows loses as it progresses the plot in a police investigation which is distancing itself from the efficient disease of the principle after becoming a tape of intrigue. Anyway is a nice film with very accomplished moments and excellent atmosphere.</body>
