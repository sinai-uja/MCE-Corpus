	<body>I remember that being a zagal I went to the cinema to see JFK and I left terrified cinema.Okay, so that same feeling I assails today after watching Zodiac, I do not know if the best David Fincher movie, but if the "classical" and contained (and the longest).To the point: who wait to see Donnie Darko and Iron Man callejeando in search of an enigmatic assassin, to stay at home, because this is more like all the President's men, or a good 70s political thriller (and a tad to that genius of Spike Lee's Summer of Sam was) to Se7en, what is not good nor badjust different (and a little longer).Over its 160 minutes attended a game of cat and mouse with exemplary planning (enhanced levels, the first thirty minutes), which is perhaps in excess of the ellipsis (there are little signs of situation every five or ten minutes, and that in a movie of 160' are many little signs) and information. Or you want blinking, that you lose.I see only one hit, and is that as I have said before, is a film "policiacoperiodístico" and not a thriller of those today, of those who directs Fincher, come on, and comes to the case (that timely expression) because there are moments in the film that are master, historical, terrifying, superlatives, and one wonders why does that tone during all the (long) footage.But then there would be no entitled Zodiac, Se2en would have been entitled. And another snag would put the characters, that not to the players (all master), which in some cases are no more. You have to see, that is the entry of Fincher on the Olympus of the directors, the rest of new Virtuosi rely more on the script, this runs as God.</body>
