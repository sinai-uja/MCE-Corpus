	<summary>curious e impressive tape of murders that are worth viewing.</summary>
	<body>With the mantra of "Based on a true story" but with many differences, have a Ribbon of the same Court (film noir) as the adaptation of the Best Seller of James Elroy "The Black Dahlia", told in Flashback and 2 parts principle (that honestly breaks the rhythm of both, a complete misadventure).Travolta plays the role of the grandfather of the director, in a manner quite unconvincing, and is that the film, dedicated to the father of this, recounts the investigation of the murders by the character played by the legendary actor of "Grease", which has already been embodied in the big screen several times.Accompanied to Travolta, James Gandolfini, away from his role as "soprano", Laura Dern, which after 14 years still see as Dr. Ellie Sattler's "Jurassic Park", Jared Letto, which still Recalling by "Requiem for a dream" (that arm agh) and his Raoul in "Panic room" of David Fincher, although I agree with all the criticisms that I read that more sensuality contributes on screen (without showing a hint of "meat") is Salma Hayek, although its similarity with the real Martha Beck is nothing short of non-EXISTENT, ah! didn't forget about the son of James Caan, the also actor Scott Caan, to which we have seen in tapes as "Into the Blue", with Paul Walker and Jessica Alba.Curioso is that this tape shows "bait" and in some moments (lime and sand, you know the curious American moralina), has a macabre corpses mixed with purinata decency, but that they were other times and that day today, females are would handle as do victims suffered on screen is also true.In end, a curious and impressive murders tape worth watch.</body>
