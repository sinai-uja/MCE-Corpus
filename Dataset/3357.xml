	<body>I have a re-visto 300. I then put a lot of candles to God for letting us to all single women and gays in the world such gift. Two hours of uncles solid running in loincloths and layer are hitting and spinning in sweat. They makes my hair like hooks just to remind you.It is highly exciting to see as Frank Miller has been able to imagine so many biceps, triceps, pectorals, chocolate bars, well formed ass and legs and bring together them in one place. Gerard Butler as possibly without you infomercials and without beard more ugly hitting a father but as you I have not looked at the face at any level of the movie I do not care. Have been able to to allow feísimo to Rodrigo Santoro (the Lost guaperas) making him Xerxes (also average in balls) to see, I will try to recall that is film &hellip; is a guy who comes out half naked and gets to climb a mountain to hair, and as very ugly monks does not leave go to war (pure envy that this buenorro and them not) because brings together 300 light coleguita clothes and go to kill Persians in the Thermopiles. That is more or less what I remember my hormones even revolutionized. And even if there is something more doesn't matter to me. I'm happy with that memory. To make it more erótico-festivo in the dubbed version the handles had the voice of Russell Crowe and Clive Owen you can request more perfection? Perhaps 300 were 600. That multiply by 2 fun but of course being a historical film this could be interpreted as a serious misunderstanding to as faithful description of the facts (irony) those stupid who say that violent films do not like women is because they do not know the heart of feminists. I want a Spartan!</body>
