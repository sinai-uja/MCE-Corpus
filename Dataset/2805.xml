	<body>Today I will talk about a film of one of my favorite genres, animation. This film is titled Ratatouille, and has been produced for Disney by Pixar Animation Studio. Just to know that it is a Pixar production, we can only imagine that it is a well made movie, full of Visual effects and very colorful, as were other films outputs from the same study as Cars, Finding Nemo, the Incredibles or Toy Story.La story takes US to France, more specifically to Paris where a rat (a simple rat)(, name Remy) has a natural talent for the kitchen, she dreams of becoming a great Chef, on his way he meets a clean ducks and clumsy dishes for the kitchen, Linguini, that by joining forces, the two will be able to become the best chef of all France through critique of the most feared critic cuisine of the country in my opinion, the film is a bit longdo, are almost 2 hours, and this is excessive for an animated film that is impossible to achieve the same rhythm throughout the entire film, despite not achieving a great success at the box office, I believe that technically beat his films? rival? as the Simpsons, or third Shrek. It can put you some stick, as it makes no any joke aimed at an adult audience as its competitors, but I think can forgive you. As all Pixar films is a moral, and is the forward and strive to exceed our limits and achieve our dreams.In conclusion say the younger members of the House are those who most enjoy and pipe to spend it with our new friend Remy. In honor of the truth, is one of the best movies of the summer. If you have not yet seen I recommend that you go to see her.</body>
