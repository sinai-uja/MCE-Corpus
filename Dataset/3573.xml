	<summary>Death of a President is a provocative and controversial film by its approach, that hides a deep critique American policy on the outside and inside.</summary>
	<body>The mockumentary is a genus that not so many years ago even existed, not to say directly that it is a fairly recent creation. Today are increasingly more managers who bet on this format that adapts perfectly to the histories of political and social complaint, especially if they are narrated with drops of a corrosive acid sense of humor.Gabriel Range, renowned director of the BBC, was launched with a particularly risky history that presents in a tone of mockumentary the assassination of George w. Bush. It must not be any Lynx to deduce that by such plot the British filmmaker has received all kinds of criticism since United States. Despite this, Range at any time makes an apology for violence or seeks to justify the acts of his alleged characters, but showing the terrible consequences that generate hatred and violence. If history raises Range outside some, would be one of the documentaries of the year, but it is fiction, the film is something take that does not offer any extra incentive (such as false advertisements of the great C.S.A.) the Viewer. The film focuses on the testimonies of various people involved, alleged footage and various forensic tests. Before this flood of information, who knows in advance that is false, the film loses interest and comes to become monotonous and boring.Death of a President is a provocative and controversial film by its approach, that hides a deep critique American policy on the outside and inside. However, and despite scoring full format to tell this story Gabriel Range fails to carry it out.</body>
