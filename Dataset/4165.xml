	<body>American comedies are all equal. It's fascinating as they also manage to attract world-class actors to make them. PS I Love You is a clear example. With a later Hilary Swank and a fashion gGrard Butler the thing has safe box office. Also given that it was shot in just 45 days it is easy to insert between major productions.Gerard plays Gerry, an adorable Irishman who is married to Holly. After an escenita of anger and uncredited Gerry dies of a tumor. But Gerry is a great guy and has decided to leave letters to his wife to help her overcome her loss. Each of them has specific instructions to meet the new Holly post-Gerry and end up with PS. I Love You (PS, I love) that gives title to the tape and rescued from novel by Cecelia Ahern.La tape is irregular and tries to insert comedy and drama with ups and downs in the script. His main actress does not believe what makes any scene and seems to be clear that the field of the tragicomedy not goes with it. Gerard Butler makes desperate attempts between Leonidas and the Phantom of the Opera wearing Palm and singing in almost all of his scenes.Is a product, unfortunately, surplus.</body>
