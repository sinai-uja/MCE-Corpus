	<summary>Simple romantic comedy, where the music is the main dish and where there is no chemistry between the actors (and is that the character of Barrymore not believe anyone...)</summary>
	<body>I don't know why neither led by do not know which reason, I found myself the other day with my coworkers talking film, as no, ended up leaving this tape out, one of those who likes both "my middle rib" and that I try to flee as soul that leads the devil, led by curiosity, by panic and some other obscure object of desire that I will not try to nobody me macho misogynist call agreed to see her, and my opinion once finished viewing later has not changed one iota of what I thought before seeing. Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore made up a comedieta sweet, easy to watch, just as easy to forget those which one notes without much interest in any TV channel when it comes to the desktop, and while debate with the family the last goal from Beckham can lift view of coffee that accompanies him, follow the thread of the same. Perhaps, the only thing that I liked it was the soundtrack, and more repeat over and over again issues, that by itself of the same taste, is that both repeat and repeat, earlier that one end of the film singing the main theme of the same, that Pop Goes My Heart whose video reminds many of those who accompanied my musical childhood or my later teenage years and when I desmarqué musically of the children's music or what was heard at home; but no, I am not here to talk about music, especially when it is an issue which could not write more than 2 consecutive lines. Anyway, in short, a simple romantic comedy, where the music is the main dish and where there is no chemistry between the actors (and is that the character of Barrymore not believe nobody.).</body>
