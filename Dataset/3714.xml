	<summary>One can feel completely stupid to delocalised, glad to have left parked at its premiere, and taking advantage of already on DVD pick up more calmly...</summary>
	<body>I admit that I have a strange relationship between love-hate, difficult to qualify for a movie buff, while "Trainspotting" and "28 days later" seem large films, as well as risky on your bill with Danny Boyle, I could not with "The beach" and although I tried to endure its almost 2 hours of footage, I became heavy and boring but not power.With this, after their first minutes, we find a well made, debtor, tape in equal parts as "Solaris" and tape at the same time to others with a conscience (the film "Live" is the further reference that comes to mind right now), although clich√©s fantasmagoricos space and that Boyle subjected to his actoral (politically correct) cast are sometimes extremely outdatedthey are not bad in this kind of fantasy sci-fi, even "sing" more than what one could imagine.The tape seems divided into 2 segments, on the one hand we have the promising start, where in addition to presenting us characters we reveal the mission with all kinds of detail, to then (perhaps after a test-screening where the expected result was not achieved) it becomes the typical space fantasy where the consciousness, in the purest style "live" has the leaduntil you reach the "Monster" part and where the ones who left, have to fight, and there is where the film becomes something that we have seen before.A tape that I left it parked at its premiere, and taking advantage of already on DVD I decided to resume more calmly, because I did not wanted to pass me as when I went to see the epic and strange tape of George Clooney, that while I was impressed by the film, had to listen to my about the incessant murmur of disappointment, which may sound as poetic you want, but when have left you almost 7 &euro; on screen, one can feel completely stupid to delocalised.</body>
