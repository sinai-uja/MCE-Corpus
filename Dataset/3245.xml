	<body>Although it sounds like a cliché, in many cases the reality outperforms the fiction. And for which does not create it, there are plenty of examples, one that most caught attention was the US Government hired Hollywood writers to make write them fantastic attacks and to prepare for them.But not always there to go far to find an example, and what happened to the girl by Cristina Valdivieso, protagonist of love me, is good proof of this. The film tells the story of Pancho (Darío Grandinetti), a cincuentón that meets a girl, her granddaughter (Cristina Valdivieso), when her mother, Lucia (Kira Miró), sends his father victim of despair. Pancho seek his daughter and trying to help her, and at the same time do the same with her granddaughter. Love me is a story of characters, feelings, emotions, which tends to soft and free melodrama with great ease. Beda Docampo Feijóo has failed to establish the boundaries between sincere emotion and the cheap pasteleo that just making your tape. Furthermore, the script is somewhat weak and little credibility, and has some details that border ludicrous (in the pejorative sense), as the dialogue between the characters of Luis Brandoni and Dario Grandinetti. Precisely, the work of Argentine actor is most notable throughout the film, but also deserves mention an emaciated Ariadna Gil. love me is a totally recommended film for lovers of sentimentaloide melodrama, that they will enjoy and cry in equal parts. The rest of viewers, better abstain, except for those who want to see Ariadna Gil emulating Rita Hayworth in Gilda.</body>
