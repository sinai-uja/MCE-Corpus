	<body>"Sand in the pockets" is the typical tape of conflicting guys, who appeared before others, with titles such as "The peak" or "I am the Heifer" put in question of the 80 youth, now, in full turn of the Millennium have to update this type of film, and the "Almodóvar" Yohana Cobo, Clara Lago ("the journey of Carol") or several secondary TV (among them Daniel Guzman or Antonio Denech) have been those who have taken over from This type of film.The problem of this film, is that the rest of the actors are bad, very bad, sobreactuando nauseam, leaving the film in a mere TV movie or pilot episode of a TV series of low length of antenna, and where the argument; at times it reminded me the song of Ismael Serrano "The escape", it gives for little, for very little.At any time one may come to believe what you see on screen, and, frankly, doesn't matter what will be the lives of 4 players kids, separate, tape points pull all possible issues, abuse, discrimination, isolation of parents and children, bullying. Without disheveled the argument the least; That screenwriter fiera! A tape, not give for more than one viewing and I only has conquered during a few moments with their soundtrack (Quique González and elbicho).</body>
