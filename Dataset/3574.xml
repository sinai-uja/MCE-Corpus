	<summary>In a miraculous way we find one of the films most original, hooligan and hilarious years with an apotheosis Costner that reinvents the interpretations of psychopaths with a work full of nuances where the actor gives a crash course in interpretation.</summary>
	<body>Another THRILLER PSYCHO? Anyway one more than assassin that he puts a halt to justice with its brutal crimes. Another copy of the silence of the Lambs and above with two completely finished interpreters KEVIN COSTNER that after success with dancing with Wolves never ceases to ridicule both as an actor and director in the postman of the future or WATERWORLD accompanied by DEMI MOORE who lately gave us with angeles los of charlie 2 or in the darkness. For more INRI only director has a previous film on the unbearable poli by chance and producer with titles as mediocre as assassins.With all this it is normal thinking that you'll eat a hodgepodge of Championship, because of miraculous way we find one of the films most original, hooligan and hilarious years with an apotheosis COSTNER that reinvents the interpretations of psychopaths with a work full of nuances where the actor gives a crash course in interpretation.His Alter-Ego lies in the always brilliant William HURT who we saw recently in SYRIANA or a history of violence.Technically round with a script that combines fun with intrigue and terror to equal parts graceful out of all proposed with great elegance. The only but is that DEMI MOORE is still such a bad actress as always, in all ways a different film that will surprise more than one.</body>
