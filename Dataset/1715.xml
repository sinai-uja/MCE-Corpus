	<body>The truth is that not it attracted me much this film, but I have to say that I liked, and Gala Évora is one of the responsible for this. Recently emerging old friends of "Pharaoh", saying that it has nothing to do, not her arriving or to the bottom of the shoes, but for all those who we do not have known, I have to say, that the interpretation of this young actress is to remove the hat. The history of this film, directed by Miguel Hermoso, focuses on the life of a young Lola, we see how will bond since childhood to devote themselves. All this sprinkled with their struggle to make their way in a difficult world, as he is on the show, and the sad reality that all men wanted to be with her, but none dared to take the plunge and marry. His stormy relationship with Manolo Caracol, portrayed by José Luis García Pérez, as well as with others of her lovers (Carlos Hipólito), teach us the liberal and that this artist was temperamental. A biopic in every rule, which stands out mainly by the atmosphere and the big players that form the cast.</body>
