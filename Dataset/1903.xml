	<body>"A Senator has a journalist all the truth on the legendary outlaw Liberty Valance and how he, a young newly graduated in law, came to the Wild West with unwavering ideals of Justice".A masterpiece. However I must admit that the first time I saw her I felt disappointed. I should have around 15 years. My father, when it was very child her had told me, but only for the part of action, shooting and fighting. To see her I felt flooded because it was not obviously as I had been told, was much deeper. A few years ago I went to see a film forum in my neighborhood, and I was ecstatic. What beautiful intelligent dialogues, sturdy performances, perfect direction, screenplay sublime, beautiful music.!! In short, a masterpiece which speaks of love, friendship, justice, law, truth and legend. Sublime.</body>
