	<body>Few films have the "virtue" of disappoint me ten minutes, but that is precisely what happened to "Next", the last film by Lee Tamahori.Asistimos to a story in which the protagonist is a "magician", which acts in Las Vegas, with real mental powers that want to pass unnoticed. Said it might seem even interesting, but then we are witnessing shocked a myriad of absurdities: on the one hand, that "superpower" is just the ability to see the immediate future (only two minutes following!!!); on the other hand, "savvy" agents of the United States national security (without knowing how or why) go after the protagonist to propose the "original" Mission of "save the country against a terror alert"; and finally, the "painful" more concerned terrorists in search for who is going to try to stop that own preparation of the attack.History decorate Visual effects that hinder follow-up since the plot is not easy to differentiate between real actions that seek to "views" of its protagonist. The interpretation of Nicolas Cage in the role of the protagonist is so poor as expressions of his face; and his partner Julianne Moore in the role of agent of the national security, is harmful to giving the sensation that is does not believe that he got into "tremendous" filming.Without having the "power" of its protagonist, it is easy to guess that "Next" will not go to the history of the cinema as a good movie, but rather by having wasted $ 80 million and 90 minutes of footage that I might add is the best of the film.</body>
