	<body>If the Sophists lifted the head it would pipe going to the cinema to see films such as "Thank you for smoking" or "Lord of war". Selling weapons to Batiste isn't bad, and manufacture a product that gives cancer either. To the public you can be convinced of anything if one can handle the rhetoric. "Anything you can say, or do, if that helps us pay our mortgage.""Thank you for smoking" can be nice if you look from afar. Alternatively, if you grab with gloves. As experiment on how the cinema can manipulate us serves to enter a perverse game and then go back to review where the trap was. At the end the spectator sympathizes with the seller of cigarettes and he gets Mania anti-tobacco Senator. The trap is not particularly subtle, Tobacconist, although it defends bad, is tolerant; the Senator supports a good cause with intransigence.As a spectator I do not stick to the speech but there is little excitement. It could be imitated "Knight without sword", but loses all the magic in the attempt. It could have been similar to "Champion" in the relationship father son, but there is no way to digest this cocktail with a protagonist so transgressive.</body>
