	<body>In recent years the independent film surprises with unexpected successes with the plant facing the big blockbusters. Even the oscars recognize these works outside the Hollywood machine. Examples of surprising box office have in the recent little MISS SUNSHINE or between cups. Within these features we find the second feature film from JASON REITMAN after the also brilliant thank you for smoking. First thing to note is his young duo protagonist especially the wonderful ELLEN PAGE protagonist of HARD CANDY that you assume a simply brilliant future. Accompanied by another young promise to feature on supersalidos MICHAEL CERA. Between the side shine with their own light JENNIFER GARNER out of action movies where developed most of his career in films as DAREDEVIL or ELECTRA completing the cast a great JASON BATEMAN seen this year at the magic shop.This film do not expect great heroes, or same if certain characters or very intelligent people. They are characters from the street, dysfunctional families which may well be your neighbors with a problem that can happen to anyone and is fable tells us the decisions carried out to confront the slippage of the protagonist.Nice, fun with a really delicious musical choice, runs a feature film that connects with sympathy in the Viewer.Perhaps some dialogues are a little forced to break the credibility of the story. The truth is that I do not see many young people with this very biting language.Despite this small inconsistency, it seems a nice film in all its senses where breathes a positive message that keeps a remarkable narrative pulse.</body>
