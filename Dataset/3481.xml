	<summary>Mediocrity, shortage of British ideas and nonsense; three in one for a decadent film that still imitating everything bad in their American Masters.</summary>
	<body>I have always defended the European cinema to the American for several reasons. The first, and more weight, is that I sincerely believe that it is much more deep and full of ideas that the Hollywood; and second, because I recognise that I am of those who is proud of its roots and firmly believe that the fact of being the most civilised continent should be noted in all cultural manifestation.Unfortunately, on many occasions I find films which have been built without any basis, drawing on the topics that are rotting American cinema and only seeking, legitimately, that Yes, the box office and the carefree Viewer that not look further than a couple of hours of vacuous entertainment.It is the case of Alex Raider, an absurd pseudoinfantil history of spies, with little argument, absurd and uncouth winks to the cheap comedy and without more pretensions that parody the classic British stories of spies and action. Honestly, I don't think that a film can thus conceive rather than as a simple mockery of Fleming, Fortsyth or Le Carré novels. It is clear, especially in the beginning, the parallel with James Bond, especially in the scene of the car.Testimonial the appearance of Ewan Mc Gregor and repellent and hateful over not being able to the repugnant protagonist Alex Pettyfer.Pobreza, mediocrity and vulgarity. Three in one for this pilonga chestnut that has crossed the English channel to bore up to the stones.</body>
