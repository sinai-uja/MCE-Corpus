	<body>I see the pull and no reason Motel Hell of ad 80. Farmer Vincent runs a road motel next to his sister Ida (the sita Balbricker of Porky's) and is famous (at least 150 kilometers) by their smoked meats.I imagine that with this you don't need to know more about the movie. I do not know because plant to the victims in the garden and hypnotizes them with rays leiser before chop them and smoked them.It is overwhelming affection and sympathy of the farmer Vincent and is demonstrated in and falls in love with his naive victim (and hostage but do not know) even decided to pass by the altar, something very similar to what was happening in the great I drink your blood between rapist and victim.Farmer Vincent has a brother sheriff who knows nothing of the "secret" of his older brother. Go sheriff shit. Acojonante climax between man - pig (is the farmer Vincent, clear) and madero: duel on chainsaws!At the end the farmer Vincent, at a time to remember, reveals that he used preservatives in the meat (!) while he is dying. Priceless final stretch.</body>
