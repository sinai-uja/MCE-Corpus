	<body>The deceased BOB CLARK reaching fame with comic saga PORKYS directed at the beginning of his career notable works of the most visceral horror SLASHER BLACK Christmas and above all in is masterpiece who happens to be in my opinion the best title of his filmography.Two great performers worried with his great characterizations, RICHARD BACKUS of television fame after his participation in several series, REMINGTOON STEEL or law and order. Accompanied by the always solvent JHON MARLEY to just participate in the godfather.This work can be summarized in a camouflaged horror about ZOMBIES film when in fact is one of the most brilliant metaphors on the dramatic consequences of the war of the Viet Nam. Young people who came totally insane drug addicts who never returned to be the same.CLARK used masterfully like other authors as Romero in his saga ZOMBIE or DEAD CREATURES PARKINSON the living dead subgenre to break molds based on fierce criticism demonstrating that occasionally horror also serves as a denunciation film.Not missing however moments of open anguish nor something Gore, brilliant dialogue, photography sick with notable music help create one of the large cinematographic references in the genus unjustly forgotten.</body>
