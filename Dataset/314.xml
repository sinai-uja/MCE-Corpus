	<summary>Even the presence of Jacqueline Bisset and his final half-hour (spare) manages to pick up a movie that makes water after their excellent first minutes</summary>
	<body>According to progresses the plot one wondered, that seeing this, I went with "The fire of revenge" that his mount video-clipero and led to their flat strangers in my a strange headache, with "Domino" happens to me equal to half of the movie one is tired of both flat, contraplano and flicker.The tape is intended to be a mixture of tapes as "Assassins Natos" with a hyphen that sometimes picks up scraps of love a true "Romance" or "Pulp Fiction", unfortunately turns out to be a tape of action (with members of "Sense of life") where everything is just as tired and boring, maybe, the best on screen is the presence of Keira Knighley and Mickey Rourke (again from now after his excellent work in "Sin City")not even the presence of Jacqueline Bisset and his final half-hour (spare) manages to pick up a movie that makes water after their excellent first minutes.In short, a tape that should have ended with the same intensity with which begins, no wonder that it has taken "centuries" to reach theaters in our country.</body>
