	<body>Good film cartoons, somewhat extravagant, as the family Robinson which gives rise to the tíutulo. It is full of great ideas to everyone more imaginative. It does have a good time and has positive teachings. However, if this is true, I think it fails him somewhat the pace and used tones. Its development is uneven, resulting the description of the above family Robinson worse, as my seems, from the film.Describe the characters too rapidly, with a chaotic pace and showing too much detail to be appreciated in detail. What happens is that this description has vital importance for the film total understanding, as evidenced in its very nice final.The best is what is happening in the present, rather than in the future, which, in principle, it might seem paradoxical, not in vain more imaginative might expect to happen in the coming years. But it is not, perhaps Yes visually, but not in emotion and fun. In the future, the fight with the dinosaur is very well, the rest, not so much. At present, however, we are witnessing several frankly worthy scenes, such as the fair of science, the moment in which we discover the true personality of the "man of the bowler", or the beautiful epilogue.However, and despite the decompensation, is an enjoyable tape of animation of the fantasy genre, endowed with a marvelous music conducted by the always excellent Danny Elfman, and an admirable design. I think it is worthwhile, even if it is an improved job.</body>
