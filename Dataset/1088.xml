	<body>The question raised her once a friend in this way: If all the Madrid players hired them the Barcelona what you should do? You would change team and you would do the Barcelona? The answer is that players are not the team, right? A photographer drove six types in your photo. Then, when the photo was made home, across the country wanted to entertain the heroes. Those who came in the picture were not those who put the flag, were those who changed the flag the next day it was discovered. Does that matter? Eastwood said that an admonition.It is the paradox of Kubrick in reverse. In "Paths of glory", a battalion refuses to move forward on the Hill of ants and rather than shoot everyone, is formed court-martial five drawn randomly. Is it fair that pay these five unhappy?Eastwood has made good Narrator with his last films fame. But someone has to say it has been a stop on the way. Away from narrative "Flags of our fathers" is a pure and simple, reflection and, if it wants to be a colloquial term, with a brick. In "Million dollar baby" more than enough reflection of Morgan Freeman who judged the protagonist with his voice-over; There is more thought in "Flags of our fathers" and less story yet.In fact, even I am convinced the reflection. It goes on to say that the celebrate is not the photo or the list of soldiers really flew the flag: the heroic is the true story of what happened. I think that the celebrate is nothing of what has this film, unless "heroic" has become, suddenly, a synonym of "media".</body>
