	<summary>Ideal tape to see at Christmas where it shows us, that ideal of overcoming that much like in the family film.</summary>
	<body>Always I've confused this film with "A world tailor-made" Peter Chelson, one day, talking with friends, asked (without knowing that film we were talking about) in that minute leaving Jim Carrey in the film, everyone laughed and told confuse them!!! The movie which comes Jim is in "The unforgettable Simon Birch" so it was not forced to look at my usual place and I have to see her.Comment that this tape, however much that confused her, he had managed to watch on TV some loose scene, but never more than 2 or 3 min, stressing also that I had always been the seemingly fragile little Ian Michael Smith (his first and only film), accompanied by Joseph Mazzello, Ashley Judd, Oliver Platt and as I have said, Jim Carrey.Es striking as its director, Mark Steven Johnson, shot this film, based on the novel by John Irving, "Prayer for Owen Meany", in an excellent manner and with hints of tapes as "Account with me" or "My girl" and then lost in things like "Daredevil", "Elektra" or "Ghost Rider", successes which have raised many $ at the box office, but which have a very bad film Bill behind.Ideal tape to see at Christmas where it shows us, that ideal of overcoming that much like in the family film. And is that our little protagonist is a great example of this, as well as the surprise factor of the protagonist, and that "human miracle" which is the small protagonist, apart from many of those moments that remain in the retina of the Viewer for a long time, mention of true humor eschatological very of the taste of the "kids" by the House.In the soundtrack of Marc Shaiman, appear in addition, artists such as Babyface, James Brown or the great Marvin Gaye, accompanying the tape of Steven Johnson.De new masterfully ended with an excellent phrase of the Narrator (Jim Carrey); "When you lose someone, you do not blow, but little by little"</body>
