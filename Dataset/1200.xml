	<summary>Failed attempt to emulate an atmosphere of concern than ever is at the height of what its director has proved that it is capable of doing.</summary>
	<body>Since I was pleasantly surprised with time of brave (whose criticism can also be read on this website), I was curious to see the bottom of the sea, earlier work by the own Daniel Szifron and the production company falls within the genre of suspense or thriller. I do not think I that can quite exactly fit into none of these categories; rather it is a kind of drama tinged slightly distressing, as if it intended to create the atmosphere so persecuted hitchcockiana on many occasions.All this without fail to recognize some merit in the cohesion of the script, very coherent and well assembled, as well as interpretation sober and correct all its cast, with the curious appearance testimonial by way of caneo, a then semidesconocido Diego Peretti, current figure indisputable Argentine film on their own merits.In any case, the film is predictable and disappointed not found with no surprises or plot twist. The film is therefore too flat, which makes it a bit boring at times, because it adopts a tempo excessively slow for the story you want to tell. And more if it is above to qualify thriller. Released in 2003, does any allusion to the situation political economic of the country at that time, that focuses on a few characters of economic level, how much less, medium high, that oddly enough, still exist in the spoiled country that once was an economic powerhouse that went to the aid of Spain when most needed.In general, a little disappointing after the high expectations I had created with time of brave. Although perhaps the blame is mine by first seeing the most current film and leave for later the oldest, when its director was much less expert.</body>
