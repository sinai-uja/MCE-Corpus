	<summary>Eliminating all the - aburridísimas - sub-plots of the book is clearly 'Eragon' is a clear and descaradísimo plagiarism of ' Star Wars: Episode IV - A new hope ' to the 'The Lord of the Rings'. If Fox is up!!! xDDD.</summary>
	<body>I have no idea how I have been able to endure such crappy.It is poorly written: there is no trace whatsoever of development, evolution, background, whatever!, the characters, and relations between them are overly forced, little credible. And the Assembly, horrifying and confusing, does not help anything. Not to mention hundreds of details and basic and vital aspects of the "original" argument of the book have jumped. In addition, leaves in evidence Paolini, that eliminating all - aburridísimas - sub-plots of the book is clearly 'Eragon' is a clear and descaradísimo plagiarism of ' Star Wars: Episode IV - A new hope ' to the 'The Lord of the Rings'. If Fox is up!!! xDDDGeorge Lucas will be in his underworld, because if not I can not I explain.I of fifteen year old also used to write stories or fantastic novelitas, which the vast majority of them were also copiatas or a medley of films which by then brought me crazy, fruit of that same movie buff enthusiasm. The difference between a server and Paolini is that he has had the value of publish it, and a few parents willing to do so.But hey, there is talk of the movie, not the book: shit. The only thing that saves is Saphira (which, by the way, why grow fast taaaaaan in only one scene?) (O.o) and Jeremy Irons. Yes, which found me Ben Kenobi. ahem!, Brom, fucking great. Very cool special effects also. and already is. Buff! And on top is a trilogy! They will have the courage (daring, rather) to make the three?I pray that not.</body>
