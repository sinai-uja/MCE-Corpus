	<body>Let's go do not be so hard critical puppy. It is amazing as it has improved graphically the life work and miracles of this good-natured OGRE than admitamosló, we love. Much has happened since that we saw for the first time the appearance of this character in the film, but despite all this time and above improved graphics, Sherk retains all its freshness, its ingenuity and originality.The writers of Sherk once more have hit the nail on, an excellent script, we live an excellent evening of cinema. The film meets the expectations expected and what I still hallucinating, is that form of combining "the moral" of life, of the tales. with a visual and verbal language absolutely current and intelligible for any type of audience (children, elderly, geeks).Characters such as Rasquitín or our beloved cat with boots and their looks delightful you will win certainly. New in this release we have a molotov cocktail of story characters that are masterfully introduced into the story. An animated film essential, with a perhaps not as good as in the 2nd soundtrack delivers but very valid and a very enjoyable pace, so it made me cut the movie.It could be that that in this film we have seen details of Sherk in his married life, its evolution as a character towards parenthood and the struggle to retain his emotional stability (values to be inculcated to the new generation of oafs approaching us) reveals a 4th sequel, as we are in the era of the sequels because miraat least of this type are expected and celebrated by his genius.</body>
