	<body>Between 2003 and 2004 horror film suffered a regression which many were grateful, half dumb teenagers gave step dirt of yesteryear. The Remakes of the Texas and ZOMBIE massacre in the great dawn of the dead made us presage an authentic revolution in the genre.Including a film premiered WRONG TURN small I enjoy remarkable success to recover formulas old but never past fashion clearly inspired by the hills have eyes or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. A film that was not news nor was expected but if that was a nice entertainment of blood with good dose of old-school action.We get a second part drinking from the same sources little or has nothing to do with the original. Only in the name in what seems like a clear business strategy, a new story begins with entirely new characters. Rookie JOE Lynch does not walk with end, small beer when it comes to offer a genuine festival GORE accompanied by magnificent special effects, a plot reminiscent of MY little EYE mixed with the typical stories of deep America. Young actors among which highlights "the massacre of Texas 2004" Erica Leerhsen and TEXAS BATLE seen in the series final destination.Them along with other fellow interpret the characters in this type of product. The Fox, the cock, the cool are good meat to the cannibals of shift, a good dish of rapid consumption raw material where a hooliganism at all times with good technical aspects in its wide range of torture. An entertainment for a good afternoon where can not ask you more.</body>
