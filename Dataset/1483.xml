	<body>Bad is that at the beginning of the film you have almost 75% of it (in the text), bad is that the soundtrack is so noisy and bland as possible, bad is that you try to give an air "roll game" without knowing very well how to do it. Uwe Boll who already directed in a nefarious way "House of Dead" based on the video game of the same name, repeat "Alone in the dark" that is the saga of Survival horror that appeared on pcs much before the legendary "Resident Evil", a film that tries to drink plenty of sources (copying without stopping) from "Resident Evil" to "Alien" passing by "Predator" or "Children of the corn" or even the series "Alias" with these aerial views l.a. Prota, Christian Slater as this major (although there is crushed in the Gym for the film) in some scenes he is literally "throwing the bofe" when it comes to running or doing some other movement away from normal, he accompanies Tara Reid, before his chest operation, honestly this girl confined to the romantic comedy ("American Pie" "Van Wilder") and allow experiments like this, and finally this Stephen Dorff as after the first "Blade" and many films of series C (of those that van direct to video) here puts its usual fronted and claims to be "The saviour of the cause".An hour and thirty-eight minutes, starting almost the same as just and that one gradually comes to understand the major failure that has been the film in the USA both public and critical. Not a single shock and everything more predictable than an episode of "Anna and the seven".</body>
