	<body>I've already seen and I am sure that now I chewed, Digest her and then surely be able to meditate her coldly, insofar as all the Star Wars films!I was delighted!Made quite some time that I was not excited in the cinema (have jumped me the tears on a couple of occasions) and probably next as my beloved "Return of the Jedi" the second film that I most enjoyed all that make up the series.The film starts very slowly and even at the beginning can become "more of the same" as in the first half hour I was quite confused by what was happening on screen (recommended seeing her in a room with THX Sound) but, however, as he was moving the plot I felt much more satisfied with what a priori thought that it would be the end result of the same (as Ã³rdago).I was delighted to find I landscapes (Alderaan) and characters (Chewie) recalled that previous tapes as well as some that he knew of "Clone Wars", the animated series Star Wars.He read a couple of reviews that the highlights were played by Hayden Christensen (and think that at the beginning it chirriaba me in his role as Anakin) and Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine - Darth Sidious) and are not devoid of reason, there are perhaps including a series of complicity which does not appear between Obi-Wan and Anakin, even though this tried (to remember the words of Obi Wan "if it stays still bursts" that has started some that another smile in the stalls)."The revenge of the Sith" is a film that manages to unite all that we have seen in prequels them earlier with these episodes with true vintage flavor that most remember in our memory as part of our very personal childhood; If it is true, it seems that Luca$ has bothered to listen to or read (forums, mailing lists) to the fans of the saga, answered thousands of questions that all we have ever wondered about the saga and however we had never seen on screen (and see that the so-called "expanded universe" is wide).Again, the excellent score by John Williams masterfully accompanies each and every one of the moments of the film, since the subjects already known by all fans to make at times we put the meat of Gallina.Tal time, and as a negative note, I will put the absolute excess of special effects, since said Ewan McGregor nor it is good for the players (that act before the Croma Key) is not good for the spectators, because although it is a science fiction movie in which we know that 90% of what you will see is not real, remains credibility to real little that if there is on the tape.Without a doubt it is one of those tapes that will be part of one way or another in the history of the current cinema.</body>
