	<summary>The perfect creature is a second entertainment film row, pretentious, boring and does not offer any incentive for viewing.</summary>
	<body>For more years that take following the film today, always surprises the ability of some publishers to recover mediocre films and try to make them reach our country as what they are not, cult or big-budget films.Any excuse is good, and the perfect creature is a good proof of that is that in its Spanish poster appears more clearly the phrase "from the creators of the Lord of the rings" to the title of the film. It is not the best of omens to begin referring to the trilogy by Peter Jackson, which by the way, has nothing to do with this project. However, at first glance the perfect creature had good mimbres to be one more than acceptable tape fantasy and science fiction. However, the film is misleading since your first minute, and all the goodwill with which the Viewer could go to the cinema disappears after the initial prologue. The script, simpleton and vulgar, lacks full of originality and own fantasy elements, and history there where take it. The perfect creature has also a tepid whiff to political-religious speech with certain éitcos of the most absurd and child leave. Visually, the film uses the copy of previous work, and Glenn Standring leaves his personal imprint offering a chaos to pretend to be original. Only the presence of Dougray Scott (would one day give you a character that is not tormented?) and Saffron Burrows a little saves the situation.The perfect creature is a second entertainment film row, pretentious, boring and does not offer any incentive for viewing. And still has to be to thank the film pass without penalty or glory by the Billboard, and is that he could have created a great discomfort in certain institutions.</body>
