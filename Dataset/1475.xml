	<body>The theme of the translations of the titles of the films is curious. For example in this, have gone from being ases smokers to hot ACEs, which is much more revealing to the Viewer. By the way, do not understand why English is called ACEs smokers, given that smoking almost no one in the movie. ACEs if they leave, awhile.The film is about a mobster chivato called Israel another mobster wants to settle and that start you the heart by a "remove me beyond sentences". So offer a million of dollars for this vital body, which makes that a group of assassins of the most disparate, come and each of which more and more violent and despicable. In these, a pair of FBI police are dealing that not kill you, given that is key in a case against the Mafia.Madre mine, that orgy of rites and more shots, violence and more violence. A Symphony of brutality is not suitable for the tender and sensitive eye. There were moments of the movie that I estresaron a lot, either by the volume as always is brutal, or by the amount of nasty things that passed. That I said that can be counted the same with a little more than subtlety. But leaving that aside, I have to admit that I was surprised much of the same development and that under violent doses there is a script and a story with an interesting and surprising ending. To say that my medium Zucchini I liked it is all.In short, ultraviolenta film of mobsters and killers, which runs mostly in a hotel, showing us the more elaborate methods to kill someone. I am not loved, but I am convinced that will become a reference of the genre film.</body>
