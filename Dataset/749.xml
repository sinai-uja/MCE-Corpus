	<body>"Saw" thought me one of the best films of horror and intrigue of last winter, after its success in the U.S. (funny surprise for a product intended for video which premiered by chance and that has filled the coffers of the independent production company "Lions Gate"), logically came the sequel and now his third (and soon his fourth), far worse than the original tapewhere the first half an hour, with an opening of film that recalls the original stresses and where one prepares for another good recital of "bait". Perhaps the drawback that I see in this third part, is that you one, after the start prepares for a resolution again at the height of the first, and in this, with a fairly obvious simplicity leaves us with the long teeth (Yes, there will be a fourth part) waiting for that in the next tape we it have something else, because in this after much lightheaded Partridge, little, to say nothing, we return to count. Tramposilla (as it can not be otherwise) with a narrative structure divided into two simple scenarios, and a roster of actors productions of a pair of $, finally, that the fans of the first will enjoy again with the adventures of Jigsaw, but little to say nothing has to contribute to the genre, a simple bluff fledged. That if, have managed to not look the suckling pig roasted with equal desire than before with a couple of images and a couple of noises.</body>
