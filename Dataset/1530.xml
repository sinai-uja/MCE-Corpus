	<body>Am curious to J - what a role (and almost a record) deferential to which we are accustomed, leaving this time was the last environment glamorous romantic comedies that, fortunately or unfortunately, we are accustomed, juntandose with our most international "Antoniou", a tape that could be perfectly on the "alternative" side of the film more serious and rigorous, with this film, who plays a theme as real as life itself, in which the hardness of it leaves us out during good part of the footage.It is not easy to play a topic which tells the tape of Gregory Nava, since there are many interests at stake, on the one hand, the multinationals that have led their companies to produce cheaper the more best Mexico, (those $5 paid per hour of work the "maquiladoras"), then see how Mexico does nothing to prevent the systematic of innocent women massacre; It is not something that has been invented for the film, is something sadly real, hundreds of women die raped in Mexico after leaving work, it is hard, paradoxical in the times in which we are, but so.Sorry for the roll, but so intense tape, can not let go, and even highlight the presence of our Juan Diego Botto, also on screen, sharing images (and others) with Jennifer Lopez Finally, tremendous in all its splendor, a film that does not leave anyone indifferent and that it should be compulsory viewing.</body>
