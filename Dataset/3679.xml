	<summary>An innovative film in the subgenre that inexplicably not considered as better than the horror gave in the 1990s.</summary>
	<body>A tristísimo film where the ZOMBIE is used as a terminal illness that just about the life of its protagonist, each minute feels Calvary thanks to an outstanding "GILES ASPEN" Although not to miss the opportunity of GORE, everything is a background by importing the main character, his personal drama and his thoughts. An innovative film in the subgenre that inexplicably not considered as better than the horror gave in the 1990s and perhaps one of the best films about the ZOMBIE phenomenon. ANDREW PARKINSON and his actor protagonist deserved more luck. To claim.</body>
