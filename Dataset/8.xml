	<body>The key to evil is not a bad film, but disappointed if you're going to see a horror movie. Presentation of the House and the main characters becomes very long and boring and also the theme of witchcraft and Voodoo isn't very well represented. In the movie it shows some skewed vision of the phenomenon of witchcraft, with an American stench to the series "haunted" that pulls back, especially at the end of the film. Above are invented that roll of the judú which is like Voodoo but was born in New Orleans. What is the difference between Voodoo and the judú? Well no, it's clear.It is true that the film becomes heavy in many sections, but it must be acknowledged that in other history regains interest and some intensity. The character that leaves better standing in the key of evil is the old woman whose persecution by dragging down the aisle is most notable and "scary" movie. While the ending is totally predictable, in the end "evil triumphs", which thank lately with both script pastelón.There are many things that do not fit in this film and one of them is the young protagonist's relationship with the old man. The temporary madness of the protagonist at the end of the film that the blind explains nor very well to act as an energúmena. There is much difference between sanity that shows the girl at the beginning and the last scene of the mirror. The director, Iain Softley, incurs many clichés of the genre such as the haunted house, doors, locks and keys, noises, antesustos-scares to lead us to a final climax that can more action than terror.Ultimately, the key to evil is a good paranormal thriller but you cannot make shade to the glorious "The ring" of the same writer.</body>
