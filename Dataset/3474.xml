	<body>Portuguese horror movies is absent, only is recognizable to my a couple of co-productions.Armando de Osorio in the saga of the Templars had production Portuguese as well as the saga of ZE DO CAIXEO half Brazilian and Portuguese capital, apart from that little can highlight one of the most unknown in our lares cinematographies.The couple TIAGO GUEDES and FREDERICO SERRA after some certainly interesting shorts. RAIO, agree now on pointed a talent to describe family relationships. With performers from the culebron two loves, that would probably be the favorite of both authors series that draw from it all its actors.This film confronts several fronts with great elegance, on the one hand traditional legends of his country, where there is no shortage exorcisms, spiritualism and possessions.On the other hand it deepens in family relations with great firmness, helped by the good to make the cast.That nobody expected shrillness nor pure terror, the music is not high, not contemplate murder in mass or psychopaths hungry for blood.It is a temperate film, shot with great neatness taking its time in each one of the legends that ends up affecting the family. Breathtaking views of nature where the great photography, elegance in the sets and costumes with the appropriate music accompanied all this in a good script is checked. It is a serious terror with well described characters arriving to create tension and discover juicy Portuguese folklore.Recommended despite its slow pace.</body>
