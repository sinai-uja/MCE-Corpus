	<body>You should have seen the poster before seeing the film, I would have saved the sleepy time.The film is about brothers, specifically two, one of them is in a horfanato and the other with a good family. So on the horfanato escape, rescue the other and they will find life in Venice. Seconds rather than eat them rats, appears another kid with a mask of pointy nose which leads them to its cache. None other than the Prince of thieves in person is the mysterious kid. One day, an order reaches his band of young thieves, which dinamitará the foundations of human reason (or something) so.Well, what to say that no you imagineis? A picture so the chavalada take the afternoon at the cinema and the parents acurruquen to take the siesta. A story facilitates, some very young characters and some very childish situations make elders we do something soporíferos to watching the movie. I finished not like, not by anything in particular, if not for that I had a preconceived idea very far from what I found. For next time, mind blank before seeing anything.In short, the muchachada will enjoy the adventures of this group of young thieves. Parents, I guarantee it.Rating: 3 out of 5 If you're a kid. If not with a 2 is that it kills. If you're from Mars may give him a ** ^ ¨¨ ^ ** on $$ %$ &amp;$;)</body>
