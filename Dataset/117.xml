	<body>The poster for the film, seems that Truman is prepared in the barrier to shoot a lack. There, grabbing the urogenital area with this dull and mannered hand that holds an everlasting cigar. Incidentally, what sexy was tobacco before, right?The film is about the period of time in the life of Truman Capote, which invested in writing his masterpiece "A cold blood". One day, Truman in a newspaper read a horrible murder undertaken in a small town. Moving the people to write an article, but upon hearing of the alleged murderers, Capote gets excessively involved in what he sees as a tremendous literary Philo.The truth that the film I was disappointed enough, given that expected me something more exciting, and life that show us Capote is very boring. They teach us the obsession that reached by this story, and we profiled as it must have been this writer. But the truth that fails to engage, is long and not you understand well the bitch that gives for this crime. The performance of the actor who embodies Truman is very good, also highlighting Spanish dubbing makes fully repellent to this gentleman. The assassins also do very well its role, but it is that history is not so interesting as for almost two hours.In short, a long suckling pig smooth for a short siestecilla (or long meditation). I guess as a movie it will be a wonder, but for the viewer of flat encephalogram and popcorn (I) is infumable.</body>
