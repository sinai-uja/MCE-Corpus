	<summary>Another attempt of American industry to lead youth, monopoly fantasize film market since years ago, almost in exclusive, Harry Potter. Entertaining and well structured, but perhaps somewhat lack of pace at times.</summary>
	<body>Harry Potter marked a turning point in youth cinema, that it was not only a success unprecedented in this genre, but it also opened the way to an endless number of productions based in fantasy literature. Americans, to film little business vision but will be good, participated from the outset in the project based on the novels of J.K. Rowling, sensing the potential for development of the adventures of the young Wizard. Seven years later, J.K. Rowling is the first woman to have won more than one billion dollars by writing, and Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) young with greater fortune of United Kingdom. But Americans still considering this saga as a primarily British product, by what are already some years seeking a genuinely Yankee alternative. The Chronicles of Narnia, or movie before us today are clear examples of this hard fight of American industry by leading the market of fantasy films. Bridge to Terabithia tells the story of a boy and his new classmate, who quickly become best friends, despite some initial setbacks. Complicity leads them to create a parallel to the real world of fantasy. In Terabithia will be rulers, will be facing the dark powers and meet incredible beings. The environment is superbly recreated, and both the picture and the interpretation of children is more than acceptable.Bridge to Terabithia is dynamic, entertaining and above all, an ode to friendship. Katherine Paterson wrote the novel in 1976, after the death of his son's best friend, to try to help him overcome the pain that he caused. And things, when done with affection, usually okay.</body>
