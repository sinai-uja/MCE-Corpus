	<body>Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor are responsible for the screenplay and the direction of Crank, a film that chronicles the adventures of a Hitman who decides to retire to share the life with his girlfriend just when inject you a poison that would cause death unless he stays in constant motion. Carreras, abuses, shoving screams and jumps fill the eighty-seven minutes it occupies. As you can see, a film that part of these premises, with this simple plot, can not aspire rather than to entertain, to have a fun time doing the improbable and grotesque its unique flag. Jas√≥n Statham (Transporter, chaos) is one of the new action films today, since that usually portraying the typical hero cool, rude, relating despot, aggressive, rude and riotous, seasoned with a dash of elegance in the form of expensive suit, prevailing in the current film. Surrounding him tour throughout the history, and the appearance of the rest of the characters is merely timely. Statham saves certain solvency with the responsibility of carrying on his shoulders the bulk of the script (guioncito), although aided by a fast-paced soundtrack and a few games of House that although at times they are excessively abrupt, they help to imbue the viewer the sensation of distress experienced by the protagonist. Crank is a dreamlike Entelechy, a fantasy to which he has tried to give a touch of realism; But despite all is bad at all. Obviously, if we stick to the formal definition of good movie, we can not fit it there, but yes is what a film entertaining, dynamic and it certainly enchant the lovers of unpretentious action cinema.</body>
