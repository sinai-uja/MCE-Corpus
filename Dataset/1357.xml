	<body>From time to time Miramax's surprise us with good movies, and other rarely with a poster as interesting as this: Robert Redford, Morgan Freeman, and Jennifer Lopez to start, touch of attention to distributors. I understand you have to translate the titles of the films by the widespread custom in this country of adulterating a product doubling to our language, but I do not know what dog mania have taken to choose as opposed to the original titles: even runs counter to the movie itself.Do we have seen as one "Into the blue" is entitled "Lethal immersion"? come on, desktop movie title.In this case, "An unfinished life" by "An unfinished life".Any game or intention that the scriptwriter, producers or whoever he gave him the title are going down the toilet.Why I have titled the post as his "truest" although crude translation.The actors serve to give a simple story, that no simple charm: a loss pain accidental but the search for culprits is history which leads a Jennifer Lopez who flees with her daughter from an abusive boyfriend. Why it takes refuge in the ranch of Redford, his father-in-law. It coexists with the pain of having lost his son and his friend's life, the character of Freeman. He and Redford are cowboys who try to continue with their lives and overcome an incident with a bear who returns to appear in the area.A subplot pseudo-ecologista but with a more philosophical background: the search for forgiveness.The film is a minimal but exploited story of wonderful by a few business writers and directed way with good taste by Lasse Halstr√∂m. Sentences lapidary, full of philosophy, great sense of humor and humanity are distributed in one of the most recommended films of the time.</body>
