	<summary>Acceptable historical drama that suffers from the typical defects in the Filmography of the returned Verhoven, and resulting in the existence of parallel plots more characteristic of the follet√≠n than of anything else.</summary>
	<body>The black book is another film set in the times of the second world war and that the drama of the race it is Jewish in the then occupied Holland; and it does so through the life of a young Jewish joins the resistance after the murder of the family and infiltrates in a nazi headquarters which will live unsuspected situations.With a somewhat sensationalist treatment of certain aspects, indeed that it is staged in general a very divided society in which either by conviction, action or omission, the majority of people takes little compromised positions or directly in favor of the invaders.The work of documentation does seem to be very well done, and the recreation of environments and scenarios reaches more than acceptable levels. The argument, being good, loses intensity at times, and sometimes seems a little far-fetched, but maintains a positive tone quality in general.What it is true and is usual also in the films of Paul Verhoven, which leads to a sense of leaving cabos without tie, and has an excessive tendency to intersperse sex and secondary plots in parallel, as well as the fact that there are certain stoppages of play throughout the film and scenes that little or no contribute to the total.In any case, is a good production in which the conscientious work of the cast components supplied the above shortcomings, and get that spectator pass like a while entertaining, to know a part of the history of the 20th century in a Europe that so many lessons to the rest of the world in the field of civilization and values, but that has always been the focus of most important and destructive conflicts.</body>
