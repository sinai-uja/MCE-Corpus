	<body>Little can be said of this film, little can be counted to not know, personally not is that is one of my favorite sci fi films, although I've seen more than one trillion times (the latter if memory does not fail me in the film library of Madrid), but, as in those tapes that one you can see and vces there's always something to reedescubrirso taking advantage of this excellent new edition on DVD (and will be) take this opportunity to return to contemplate one of the summits of the film of our time.We are, as I have already said to the umpteenth Edition of the film, this that comes with a Briefcase, a figure of the car of the protagonist, and various promotional materials, one that fans of the film (those wishing for this to appear in his epitaph of ".") I've seen things that you have not, attack ships on fire beyond of Orion. I saw "C" rays shine in the darkness near the door of "Tanhauser". All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain... "it's time to die", true it is that you have added digital effects and music (as if the tape needed), since it has aged (already has 15 years) quite well.Blade Runner has printed, his style in hundreds of tapes, whether genre Sci-Fi, or any other genre (even in commercials and games), and perhaps to many years later it happened with Matrix (not call me heretic by uniting them in a paragraph), will always be there for your query, use and enjoyment.It is curious, even funny, see the roles of people whether consecrated in cinema, from Harrison Ford, newly out of the first Star Wars, until Rutger Hauer, Young.Las unique drawbacks that I see, is that, for a start the marked character of the protagonists (the sempiterna fight between good and evil, is shown in a very sharp and precise way)(, the very good good, bad very idem), a slow pace of development that is lost in both flat long, and a little organization of villains, that if it's worth are very bad and everything that your you want, but they last less that Darth Maul in Star Wars Episode I (not call me heretic by joining them in this another paragraph).Leaving that common side, mark the excellent production design, hotel for the time I filmo (1982), as well as the costumes and sets, in addition, the future us embody (now in the 21st century) is not so preposterous, as in "Son of men" of Alfonso Cuar√≥n one is remaining and his air of true bad roll and insecuritythinking about what that, thanks to new technologies, come us front in the coming years.Particularly striking is that, thanks to the network have proliferated nicks that have to do with the tape pretty from Deckard, until Roy Batty, or the very famous Nexus 6.</body>
