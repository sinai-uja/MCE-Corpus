	<summary>Another boring production midway between the drama of desktop, fantastic comedy and drama of three to the fourth.</summary>
	<body>The career of Sandra Bullock years ago, quite a few already, that he entered into a spin. It is not to have less talent than most of their peers. In fact, it is better actress than many of those who are considered to be sacred cows, even if it means not too. The issue could be due to the unfortunate choice of his roles, always aimed at the recovery of the tug lost box office, rather than to claim as a successful actress, without success, to be.Premonition is located halfway between the drama of desktop, fantastic comedy and suspense of three to the fourth.Grosso modo, the story focuses on the existence of a young woman who leads the ideal life in the American, with her own garden cottage, a hubby Cutie and two cherubs that fill your home with joy. Suddenly, he receives a call that announces the death of her husband; upon waking the next morning finds him back to his side, but soon happen the same time again. After an initial state of confusion, he realizes the days pass messy. And that is all. The film suffers from a lack of brutal rhythm, an excessive monotony and a serious lack of narrative resources, which could be attributed to the little cinematic experience of its director, Menna Yapo (which by the way is German although the name seems not) in a princpio. But once he visiona together, comes to the conclusion that this grotesque has many culprits as intervening there in the different stages of filming, editing and post production. When there is a film with the sole purpose of entertaining, the least can ask you is to do. If not, has no reason to exist.</body>
