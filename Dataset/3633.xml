	<summary>Names keep falling in my head.</summary>
	<body>There are novels needing to incorporate maps and family trees so that the reader can understand something of the plot. This film is the perfect example that such practices should not be in the literature (do?) sword and witchcraft and give the jump to the movies. When all the characters spit 12 names per minute of undersecretaries, directors, delegates and Commissioners of the White House and environs, the feeling is the less confusing:-Oh my God, Mr. Coleman will have not worked for &hellip; - Yes, Jeff Perkins - that is the Secretary of the head of the Senate library!-Yes &hellip; need to talk with Ms. Dreyfood that you confirm us; She knew the brother-in-law of the cousin of Perkins-Oh God! The brother-in-law of the cousin of Perkins, is Bob Jones, a Commissioner for the re-election of Senator Martin!-everything fits!Total, you do not learn anything. But see parade Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford by Washington, always running and talking with excitement of the next government source that will give them the next clue to reach the scoop we all know (that Nixon was a choricete) has a charm that you cagas, although only intuyas that is the movie.Also I want to be a reporter as worship, dynamic and with a sexual life so little busy as these two; so from that I saw "The Edukators" (still pray that karma to give me the opportunity to get into a fight to defend a beggar) no other film had left such mark in my weak and impressionable personality.</body>
