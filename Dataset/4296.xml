	<summary>Nice is this foray in the world of the Japanese mining converted into Hawaiian amusement park? Unusual? Let her curious initiative that reminds the club of dead poets.</summary>
	<body>The friendly description can lead, in its relationship with cinema, different meanings: a friendly film can be obviable, heap or simply bland. Rereading what was written, it seems that in the 'friendly' term we find only negative connotations. Anyway, this movie is - and sorry to repeat me-friendly. What you will see if it is of those who decide to go to cinema.The proposal, a priori, is entertaining: imagine what is to see a lot of daughters of miners with the appropriate attire to lend a Hawaiian bailecito in the cold north of Japan. That is all, they now have to say if the argument raised is credible or not, although I have to say that there is a real story behind the Joban Hawaiian Park.Before mentioned the club of dead poets, do not want that we left behind other titles with the 'all in one' by flag, white storm case, and with that example - prepare for certain empachos - surely imagine where the shots go: honour, power of dreams, the figure of a 'alma mater', the desire to carve out a path other than the marking &hellip; this mining trip to hula goes on tiptoe through all these aspects, although there is one approach more on the weight of tradition from the thin air of the immediate future. Film is something that looks good and this film is, above all, very attractive in Visual terms, and why not say, also in commercial terms.</body>
