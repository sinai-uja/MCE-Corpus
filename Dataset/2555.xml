	<summary>It will please fans of the British writer and those who enjoy dramas with impossible love, the rest will seem a careful tape, explendidamente done, but simple and fairly mundane, so we are going to cheat.</summary>
	<body>Yesterday, at the very first thing in the morning and thanks to muchocine.net I planted in the heart of Madrid to attend the press pass of this tape, curious, on the other hand, although it premiered in October, is now in July when have decided to give it a little "vidilla", which, although she is made with taste and care details, doubt have sufficient interest to drag the masses to the cinema.And is that this kind of cinema, of time you have to like in advance, and is that Anne Hathaway, James McAvoy, Julie Walters, Maggie Smith and James Cromwell are not actors with sufficient weight or potential so we decide between this or another tape, and much that my I like Hathaway or I toss much of the footage thinking where had seen before James McAvoy (in the Chronicles of Narnia)the tape is irregularly good and is that although the tape convinces few and strangers, it gets in some moments to yawn, with its strange changes of pace, especially in the 2nd half of the Ribbon, where one wants anything else, very different from what displays on the screen.I imagine that among feminists, and fans of Austen, the film like, as I noticed both by one of the girls that went right by my side in the press, as to my friend Isa pass, big fans of the English author, if he has been faithful shaping the life of this, besides that Anne is important as Austen, but these impossible love and that drama, tires to the more shadowy spectators.In short; It will please fans of the British writer and those who enjoy dramas with impossible love, the rest will seem a careful tape, deflightfully done, but simple and fairly mundane, so we are going to cheat.</body>
