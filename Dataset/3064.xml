	<summary>I think it is not surprising to say that Neil Jordan carries out its work with the great Office assumed but little more, good photography and a technically immaculate film that suffers from a very little credible script.</summary>
	<body>We return to one of the most hackneyed themes of the film in its history, the eye for an eye, the vengeance is treated from serie b more exploited either male or female violence sex, TRILLER A CRUEL PICTURE, Filmography of CHARLES BRONSON, etc.Not everything is serie b but then for example in is occasion presents us a director of first level "Irish NEIL JORDAN signatory of wonderful titles, in the company of wolves, the crying game" starring a star recently specialized in roles of strong women that the latest releases of JODIE FOSTER is facing all kinds of dangers. The room of panic or flight plan gave greatest hits.The side include TERRENCE HOMARD "The revelation of CRASH" or MARY STEENBURGEN "PHILADELPHIA".I think it is not surprising to say that NEIL JORDAN carries out its work with the great Office assumed but little more, good photography and a technically immaculate film that suffers from a very little credible script.The transformation that suffers the character of FOSTER not believes the own actress be a fearful woman ending after a couple of crimes being a mixture of CLINT EASTWOOD and CHARLES BRONSON with sententious phrases included. How will quietly shooting happily through the streets where does not appear or only one agent of the law and nobody sees is really science fiction.Later topics, a witness who refuses to discover it, the police actually is pleased that someone clean the streets. Precisely the best moments are when FOSTER not wielding the gun, his radio monologues have great strength. Unfortunately, the set is totally failed and even very boring moments.</body>
