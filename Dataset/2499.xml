	<summary>Film about world war I aviators. It stays halfway of a romantic story in hard times and one of flying action. It can be improved much.</summary>
	<body>There are inventions of humanity that I shall never end to understand. Am not going to list them all, with what I will focus on the Zeppelin, an invention that have always found me absurd for military purposes. As you get on the battlefield something full of helium that can explode easily? Additionally, only serving for bombing and had to go super escorted. That things as silly this of the Zeppelin.The film is about a group of Americans enrolled in the French air force during the first world war. It shows the training they received the pilots, as they were relationships between colleagues, feelings, etc. In addition to, of course, the dogfights.Buff, when the film found it me slow and heavy criticism will make me very uphill. The idea is interesting, with the first military aviators in history (remember that the aircraft was invented shortly before the war). But the development is very heavy, with many main characters who are keen to show us his life and miracles. The action scenes are great, recreating a thousand wonders what should be mounted in a flying coffee of those. But lacks finish, lacking in action and have too you much trash. Either that not sell us is an action film. They prefer. Very remarkable photography, spectacular, as the soundtrack, although this last will in tastes.In short, film about world war I aviators. It stays halfway of a romantic story in hard times and one of flying action. It can be improved much.</body>
