	<body>The face of Ben Affleck is a mystery of modern science. Many insist that if the Mona Lisa smile, that if you have hemorrhoids, that if a fart, that if it is a man, so if it is is holding and point. But they overlook the face of this man, if strives is able to express with the same face joy, sadness, swallow is a grapefruit and stick a PIN in the left genital. Curious, of course, although less expressive is the making of Superman. That always have hallucinated me which have a hoyito on the Chin by manly resulting.The film is a private investigator middling suddenly found in the case of his life, discover who was the murderer of Superman. Well, specifically the actor who embodied the character at the end of the 1950s. Slowly discovers that the Hollywood life has little to do with the fiction that projects outward, and the glamour and luxury not hide if not misery and more misery.Let's start with the good news. The film has a very successful setting, type film noir, but with a current touch that is difficult to remove. The idea of the script is very good, uncovering the miserable lives of those who fall in Hollywood with the idea of being superstars. But then the development becomes slow and cumbersome, with a continuous coming and going flashback eventually mislead. It has very sad and raw, moments that contrast with each other with a little luck you shut.In short, a very good and interesting, idea has been a perfect atmosphere to develop a slow and heavy film that leaves us the bitter aftertaste of having some expectations that fail to comply.</body>
