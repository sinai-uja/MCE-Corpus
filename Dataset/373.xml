	<body>I always thought that it is perfectly possible to unite commercial and artistic. We must get rid of these topics that incite us to think that a film of action-adventure, full of vibrant scenes, cannot be cinematically laudable. Similarly, the masterpieces nor have to respond to the stereotype of long and boring film, convoluted plot and difficult to understand for most. Do not mean that this second installment of Pirates of the Caribbean is a work master, nor much less, but it is a quite acceptable production, which in no way inferior to its predecessor and that the improvement in some aspects (budget increase is noticeable).This time Jack Sparrow is facing a kind of demonic pirate that has contracted a debt to be paid with his soul eternal slavery, unless he can find the way out of the impasse. The only way to get rid of punishment as impious will recover "dead man's chest", and this will certainly meet again all his former colleagues. Along the way you realize that times change and that perhaps the eccentric Buccaneers like him are not more than anachronistic characters and endangered. Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley made a magnificent job, while Orlando Bloom, once again, shows a hieratismo and an inexpressiveness reach of very few. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead man's chest is a good movie, with moderate doses of humor; It is entertaining and spectacular, which minimizes the effect of certain plot holes. Its two and a half hours of footage are not heavy at all. The Ã­nclito Captain Sparrow sail again, to the delight of his fans. Fans including myself, I must confess, I am.</body>
