	<summary>A close regular for a saga (palomitera) quite decent.</summary>
	<body>It is curious as Disney has been able to get the most juice from an attraction (quite funny, by the way) of their theme parks, perhaps the surprise of a couple of seasons, and as it happened to be a film to a series or franchise, as you see, the final act of the film where Johnny Depp has gone back to being an actor and not the comparsa tragi-comic by my beloved Tim Burton.Gore Verbinski composed heretrying to close slowly but surely (nearly 2: 30 footage) all frames that opened in previous tapes, alluding to all the previous films and recreating flat impossible, thanks to the excellent industries Light &amp; Magic.Depp magic in his line, although this time the illustrious Captain Sparrow is more payasete than the other 2 films, the first was a strangely effeminate Captain curious, and in the second a sort of hero of action on this, however is a mere excuse and comic comparsa of the Disney film, Keira Knightley in addition, seems taken from an advertisement for Revlon, and while all the characters look look at time and dirty teeth, Keira looks always a careful look and white teeth like pearls is the only one who at the time of the pirates discovered the toothpaste?To Orlando Bloom every day stand you less, and while in "The Lord of the rings" I fell (more for a nice literary toward his character, by the interpretation of the actor itself) quite nice, every movie I've seen, with their presence makes more a pretty face than an actor with a bit of packaging, so dramatic, as comic and it is that refusal to continue the franchise, he attempts to (unsuccessfully) give it some importance to his simple character.Bill Nighy, in promotional interviews highlighted always tremendous envy gave his filming companions, by costumes makeup, while he did dressed in a strange grey pajamas, that the people of ILM is encarba turn into Davy Jones, here it seems that he has finally been able to compensate in such fact, and even for a few minutes can see you characterized as "the other" Davy Jones.Si well the story is entertainingat times can be quite liosa, since to shelve (at a stretch) to all the topics already covered, it falls in the most absolute of the líos´; in any other time, my armchair companion asked over and over again, to the failure of a server to clarify your doubts, we will have to watch thanks to the DVD the other 2 tapes.Anyway, in short, a close regular for a saga (palomitera) quite decent.PS: Do not leave the room until after the closing credits, as there is a scene which, by way of farewell, Star 2 of the main protagonists.</body>
