	<summary>Very estimable Scorsese work.</summary>
	<body>It was not easy to translate, since all, not even a part of the life of magnate got to Howard Hughes film producer and inventor. His life was, until his voluntary retirement from the madding, a continuing challenge to social and business conventions. By the way, as so many times when a man rich and therefore with much power blinded in given possession or social recognition, he left a trail of broken feelings and friendships.Scorsese moves away of hagiography, but it is undeniable that, although don't judge you does have some sympathy with his protagonist. Perhaps because he remembered himself in the fight that have or had in the past with the film industry, who postponed her glory on numerous occasions.His narrative is fluid, with notable moments of humor (the prologue or dinner with the family of Hepburn) and prodigious dialogues, quick and incisive. Various social and business sectors are subjected to mockery, chanza, or simply criticism, exemplary showing the viewer what was some kind of people in those fascinating times of the, perhaps better or at least more pure, Hollywood.Las interpretations are fantastic, easily highlighting its protagonist Leonardo di Caprio, always good actor though occasionally well-off in how easy. Here he demonstrates an immense variety of nuances that strip the soul of such a complex character. Anyway, I would stress, even above him, Cate Blanchett as Katharine Hepburn. It is curious, not resembling physically nothing to it, thanks to its stylized gestural composition sometimes its like not be already great but that even resemble as two drops of water.</body>
