	<summary>Do clearly focused it for all those who enjoy the comedy? absurd?</summary>
	<body>The fourth installment of this peculiar saga has as main references to the following films: "The war of the worlds", "Saw", "Forest", "Brockeback montain", "Curse" and "Million dollar baby" among others. The challenge was to try to make an argument capable of together disparate films, to create a new one that was not a mere program sketches type cross and Raya or los Morancos, but unfortunately not have succeed, Scary Movie 4 is a succession of fairly weak jokes, among which there are any Pearl. The director of this new release is David Zucker, a veteran in the world of comedy, which is one of the directors of the work of cult "lands as you can" and that more late was in charge of "Hold it as you can" and the previous installment of "Scary Movie" among others. This new release is clearly focused for all those who enjoy the "absurd" comedy, which makes them have a good time without expecting anything more, and "Scary Movie 4" is going to provide, since it apart from a few very spectacular special effects, has several moments that make it worthwhile having spent 75 minutes of our lives to see this movie again starring Anna Faris and it counts on the participation of Leslie NielsenCharlie Sheen, Shaquille OÂ´Neall, Carmen Electra and Chriss Elliott amongst others.</body>
