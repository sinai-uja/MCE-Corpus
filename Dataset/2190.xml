	<body>"An English Aristocrat is captured by a tribe of Indians sioux, than the undergo various torture to make sure of its value." "Once demonstrated, will become its head in his fight against other tribes enemy".An almost mythical title in the history of the western. It is a story of marked anthropological dye, describing the actual customs of Indians portrayed in the story. The film is interesting only for that reason. But there are other elements that must be taken into account to explain the great success which saw this tape. On one side is the interpretation of Harris: insurmountable. The beautiful landscapes and the action scenes, very collected. It is perhaps not as good as said some, but it is worth the trouble.Unforgettable scene in which Harris becomes full-fledged one member of the tribe. A tough, violent, cruel, shocking scene.</body>
