	<summary>A tape of breaks, dreams, and everything that is this life that we live, filmed in a sober way, without much artifice.</summary>
	<body>Everyone I had spoken of this film, its amazing dialogues, a raw, tough and dramatic, history in which many of which fortunately or unfortunately we spent time taking care of our parents until his last days, we can feel identified.This is the story of the character interpreted Quim Gutiérrez, almost a newcomer, with a career forged in the Catalan television series, a kid who tries to grab as a nail to the Red to any destination, which unfortunately has no live, accompanied by Marta Etura, perhaps the best of the film and is his character comes through our eyesIt stays in the stomach and ends in the brain, sad, concise, making you understand all their motivations.A tape of breaks, dreams, and everything that is this life that we live, filmed in a sober way, without much artifice (pa' that), with a beautiful soundtrack that helps supremely well follow the pulse of history.With one exception, namely, Raúl Arévalo, Antonio de la Torre, Roberto Enríquez, or even the final cameo of the now television Alex O'Dogherty side.In short, a tape that I had recommended and I had to have seen much earlier, given that it is almost perfect.</body>
