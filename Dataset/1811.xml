	<summary>The secret life of the Emperor Penguin. Let you carry by the history, even if the end is a bit incredible makes dent in our corazoncitos...</summary>
	<body>Since childhood I felt a kind of special fascination towards penguins, don't know how to explain it, I always have them seen as friendly animals, elegant and simple that I fell in love since my earliest childhood, it is easy at home have more than one dozen penguins of all sizes and colors, as well as the most diverse materials, the reason why I did not see the film before her don't know, but events were postponing my viewing, so far, taking advantage of its release on DVD I have done.The tape, a prodigy of the 3D animation that gives a look almost real animals, received the Oscar for best animated film at the gala this year, stands out in its soundtrack songs sung by the actors that voice will put in V.O. from Brittany Murphy (making it really well), Elijah WoodRobin Williams, Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, to the latter already her we hear singing in "Moulin Rouge" Baz Luhrmann, a tape that excites me.Polar, almost realistic landscapes (attention to the scene of the penguins walking through the Blizzard), and a fairly pronounced ecological language, and that, my dear readers, the man is the largest predator on Earth and as the workhorse of Attila, where we put the foot never regrow grass.With an excellent voice, despite the presence in different characters of the insufferable Carlos Latre, have a tape that will dazzle us in every way and is that the creation of all media (both water, as snow, ice, etc.) is more achieved, and apologize for repeating myself.If you attract the musical focuses you in the musical numbers from the film as well as its colorful choreographies, calcadas for the film of real actors, but you like, let you carry by the history, even if the end is a bit incredible makes dent in our corazoncitos.</body>
