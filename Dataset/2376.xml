	<body>Thieves is undoubtedly one of the best visually better made films I've seen in my life.Each scene has a special meaning which is not discussed with words, but that airs everything what you want to say through the eyes and the gestures of the characters, and above all of his music, that explains everything what is happening to the perfection.It is a dramatic story in which Juan José Ballesta plays a young man who has managed to survive through theft from tiny well and wants to rebuild their lives, leaving the juvenile Centre. A challenge that fails to get that society still judged him by acts of its past and again found that urge to live, when he discovers a girl tries to steal a disc in a shop and help that they caught him not.From there, develops a precious relationship which goes explaining as it is the art of stealing and you really realize how easy that we neglect our things, so far that steal, then you return to put precautions unless you forget and you return to steal. Often loop.Both crossbow and María Valverde interpretations are extraordinary, seems to lie listening crossbow to speak in interviews that seems a kid, then when you see him playing so difficult characters you falls the soul to the ground and see you fact a man. And especially not you you can lose the magnetism of these two with their gaze. Simply amazing.A good choice to be impress by Spanish films.</body>
