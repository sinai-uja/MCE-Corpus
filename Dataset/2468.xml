	<summary>The film dark, bleak and gloomy in the series, in which the cortidiana life is gaining ground to the magic.</summary>
	<body>Little promotion today need the Harry Potter films. The trajectory of their previous deliveries and the excitement generated by each book that J.K Rowling published adventures of the young Wizard, claim they are more than enough to ensure the success of the movies in which Daniel Radcliffe plays one of the most important fictional characters of the whole history.With a hyphen tremendously complex, marked by the need to condense the denser of the books in the shortest film of the boulders up to now, Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix, is undoubtedly the film more dark and dark in throughout the series, with an almost total lack of open scenarios and a clear evolution of the charactersthat they cease to be children to become adolescents.David Yates, who has been in charge of directing this installment, has stripped the characters from much of its charm, turning them into something grey beings and no time for trivial conversations and jokes. On the contrary, on this occasion, the Affairs of the earthly life, non-magical, to call it somehow carry more weight in the plot. In any case, is a good film, which although perhaps not reached the height of its predecessors, will delight fans of the young Potter, among which I must confess I find. Because to think otherwise, the Harry Potter films are not appropriate for children; or much less.</body>
