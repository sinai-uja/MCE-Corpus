	<body>You have to be very benevolent to qualify this monstrosity as film, without feet, or head, with a script made for a 4-year-old boy and an address that rather than be scary, give laughter, or fear of bad which is, as you look at it.It is true that the tape provides a small dose of tension, I believe that rather than the film, by moral obligation to enjoy the 6 &euro; entry. The protagonist to hand open hostiarla (wanted during the projection that her kill once and for all) and the argument a sort of "rehash" of tapes as "Scream", "Halloween" and "Friday the 13th".Well, the worst I've seen in what he took in 2006.</body>
