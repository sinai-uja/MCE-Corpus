	<body>It is is one of the best comedies released in recent years, what is really worrying is that it was intended to be a horror film.Because the Irish PADDY BREATCHNACH author among other absurdities as BLOW DRY, apparently it took happy mushrooms to build an argument quite incredible, more surprising is to get funding to film a story of hanging that roam giving screams in the middle of nowhere. Four kids removed from television more than frightened seems that they wonder what balls I am shooting?.To hide break us the eardrums music at full speed, as bad as the director, cast, script and everything in general.If not the you take seriously you can paste a good laugh. A 3.</body>
