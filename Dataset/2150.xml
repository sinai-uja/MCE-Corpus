	<body>Blood diamond is generally a fairly conventional film, especially in its form, in many moments is like a film of any action of Hollywood, what the difference a bit of these films is that it talks about an important subject on which never speaks in the media, the traffic of diamonds in Africa and on the very painful situation facing this continent. The fact that show the conflict diamonds so clearly is what saves him from being a simple common and inconsequential action film.Leonardo DiCaprio continues to demonstrate that he is a good actor, I think that it could become one of the greats of Hollywood and is be handsome does not have to be a disadvantage to be good interpreter. Blood diamond shows that not only Scorsese knows to get him the best performances. His role is that of a white African who is engaged in trafficking in diamonds, suffers an evolution throughout the film, which is quite predictable, but that is blame the script, rather than his performance.The other protagonist is Djimon Hounsou, an actor most known and that, like DiCaprio, has been nominated for an Oscar for this role, but as secondary. It also makes a good performance, it is a pretty reserved character which does not express what he feels, except when it can no longer more and explodes. Also has an impressive voice (in the original version, of course).As Jennifer Connelly, not draw me much attention, I think that it is correct and nothing else, as it is usually always.</body>
