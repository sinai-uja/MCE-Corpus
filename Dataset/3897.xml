	<body>Clear, if we say that it is normal that when a murderous psychopath enters your brotherhood and goes killing all the world is reasonable to leave the House by legs and call the police then we would have been without film in five minutes.Black Christmas is a funny comedy, no, no I was wrong movie, if taken to laughter from the beginning is possible to spend an hour and a half with continuous laughter product of the pathetic situations that you occur to this writer that will surely be at this stage empachado of eggnog. A sadistic patient, brother of the type of Sin City, or at the least as yellow like him, killed his entire family after spending half a lifetime locked in his house which is now a massive University student residence in the 1980s. Yupi! We will do so in the 1970s and this would have been the igualicas of the genus of serie B, but in 2000 we intend to put money into the film have more than substance why we lose this show of painful deaths. My advice is that you expect her to draw on DVD and her you rent in full Christmas orgy next year to see with friends that rant on Christmas accompanied by large doses of alcohol, try to organize a club for guess who dies before and who survives and if you not laugh is that you do not have blood in the veins. If you would like to take seriously, then nor her see.</body>
