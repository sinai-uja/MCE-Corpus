	<body>The first thing is that me I pulled much of the promotional period of the tape thinking that the last film by Curtis Hanson was a romantic comedy, and is that I can not, it is to see Drew Barrymore on screen and thinking that this is the umpteenth such tape starring the singular "ET blonde", but no, we have a tape of PokerI play I do not know and that much who has played to the Mus in my life, I have not the slightest interest learn and/or know.Especially when the tape, like in the long and heavy legal movies, based on dialogue in the game, much of their "action" table, less evil than Eric Bana, actor that I have in great esteem from "Chopper", "Hulk" and "Munich" (where he finished enrapture me completely and show me that it will be one of the great, so no more), and Robert Duvall, which is of these actors are only appear briefly on screen since pays one invested (time/money) to see for there acting, even makes someone normalucha as Debra Messingaqui shine with their own light as sister of co-star; attention to the cameo from Robert Downey Jr. (which in not long known as "Iron Man"), in addition to the promising title of credit to the sound of The Boss Springsteen.El landscape of Las Vegas, which both us we have become accustomed, both the series and the movies here is one character, and we also have the incentive that much of what it hasis already known in advance by the Viewer from the sources of the Bellagio, passing through the streets of the city of Nevada (Aragon raises open something like) the problem that I see in the tape, which, even with an exceptional argument and a distribution fairly well committed is the sensation of knowing too much in advance what will be happening in the development of film, and is that this mania so recurrent that he now has to fall over and over again in common (recognizable by all) places are rutilantemente stupid, and get that, following the submission of the characters the tape go deflate is losing interest, as well as emotion and getting that in 2 hours of footage, history throws any surprises why this mania of longer stories than perfectly you can count on less footage?In short: A myth as Curtis Hanson film (theirs are "LA confidential" and the despised "8 miles") is becoming increasingly more fall layer, and their stories or reach the public or even scratched the surface of the consciousness of the Viewer; hard, but real.</body>
