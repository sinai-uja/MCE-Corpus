	<body>I think that we have finally found the way to remove the map of mediocre actors Ben Affleck: let him go.Comparisons are odious and as he has chosen for his debut in the long an adaptation of the novel by Dennis Lehane, author of Mistic River, is unquestionable that tone, content and complaint must refer directly to Clint Eastwood and his work to measure this foray into the greater Affleck brother Thriller. And obviously quite worse standing although it manages to provide some consistency with this story about the search for the truth about the abduction of a girl to unravel the events surrounding his capture. Although it has been used the case of Madeleine to speak of her little has who see this film with the story of the disappearance of the English small so who wait to see the search of the girl child during the film will find a little upset.Casey Affleck get to be credible, much more that the elder brother, carrying the protagonism of the narration and surrounded by a handful of solvents and right side while the black and loaded with the address environment helps you to maintain the tension of the narrative with some dignity. To be one opera prima must acknowledge some merit, some minor errors as ending the first part of the tape very quickly leaving almost half of the footage for the outcome achieved the spectator to relax and lose part of their interest. Moderate for both Afflecks applause.</body>
