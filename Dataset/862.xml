	<summary>Technically it is a virguería, which no lapses in no time, but with one of the great pillars seriously damaged, that of the script.</summary>
	<body>The film itself is a fat churrete, history is more simplistic, flat, stupid, repetitive and inconsistent that we have seen in superhero movies (already alone tend to have some of these aspects), places emphasis on data that is more than spare sobreentienden and then left in the dark, or gives to know others that are not so obvious. The cast is correct. and point. Routh is Reeve or Spacey is Hackman, that to begin with, but to follow, it seems that the protagonist had always in mind 'get along' with the public doing a performance trying to resemble Christopher Reeve. Spacey is magnificent, and the role comes to or painted, but I think that it is somewhat untapped, has a couple of little scenes that really convinced me 100%.In the technical section should be noted above all gotten things and have the glorious and magnificent direction of Bryan Singer which gives the movie a perfect rhythm, a few action scenes (few) fantastic and wonderful images (perhaps with an excess of flat beams which to me I love them), certainly the best of the film. The picture is very good, with some really stunning pictures and more in IMAX. and more in 3D! and Ottman out quite graceful hard comparison test with the maestro Williams, creating a very good score for the footage.In short, a film which is technically a virguería, that no lapses in no time, but with one of the great pillars seriously damaged, that of the script, tedious, repetitive and simple until exhaustion. That Yes, entertaining is a long time.</body>
