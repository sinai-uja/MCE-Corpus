	<summary>Fantastic adventures (for implausible that are) with the new hero Ben Gates, and their friend as listíssssimos.</summary>
	<body>Second film adventure of Ben Gates and friends willing to endanger their lives in order to find the truth.Here is still more problem or search for some imagination, the footsteps of its predecessor, proving to be a comic book adventures, allegedly realistic, at the end but truly fantastic given what little or nothing credible that is everything.No, I know that he is it not seem credible, is that nothing makes sense of the measure but nothing is minimally plausible.Situations, filmed almost all at breakneck speed, so that only the viewer visual break, they occur, say, so that there is no analysis of what is happening, being all a flurry of levels after levels.Luckily I once the camera stops and is when the protagonist speaks for the first time with the President of the United States. It is the best moment in the film, as the two talk, they talk, saying things fantastic dye, but not overwhelm the viewer with many levels, loud music and impossible situations.In Haw passes the time without the slightest problem. It is an entertainment easy and superficial, quite less achievements than its predecessor.Not bad and the photography is beautiful, highlighting scenes as the of the famous mount (Rushmore) of the faces of Presidents of the United States, but lacks consistency to be remembered past several hours of his vision. And among other things, by the ease in which good achieved its objectives, by very rather impossible that are. So many fantasmadas the truth is just a little hartín.</body>
