	<summary>Allegation to freedom, in a future that can remember both "Fahrenheit 451" and "1984" (not to be confused with the Michael Moore film), which also brought like-minded Kurt Wimmer for her not yet released in Spain "Equilibrium".</summary>
	<body>One of the films most win had to see in this year 2006 (and more) when its premiere was post-puesto from November 2005 to March 2006. Directed by James McTeigue responsible for second unit of the "Matrix" saga as well as "Star Wars", the tape, produced by Joel Silver and (in the form of script) was welcomed by the Wachosky brothers is a plea to the freedom, in the future we can remember both "1984" as to "Fahrenheit 451" (not to confused with the Michael Moore film)of which they also released similar Kurt Wimmer for her not yet released in "Equilibrium" Spain ideas.Well, I do not get lost in data, which but one does not know, and then go to the "heart" of the matter, the tape, as I have said is overflowing with freedom, and I will say more, had serious doubts about how Hugo Weaving (who never shows his face) was going to bring the drama crazy V need, as well, not only it provides [I had the luck of seeing the film in V.O.S] but that also you do not need to see his face, as with the tone of voice we clearly imagine what's behind the mask of the masked vigilante. Natalie Portman has always been my devotion Holy, so I cannot be objective in his interpretation (in a couple of scenes is I have jumped the tears), making of Evey vehemently absolute, quite unlike his character in the comic (I dare say that much more mature this "role"). John Hurt get what is intended and is that the public will take a tremendous hatred (as a Sutler, dictator), so if its role makes credible what more can ask you?</body>
