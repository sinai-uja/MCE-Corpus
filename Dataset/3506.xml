	<summary>Estimable tape of intrigue, with a good climax.</summary>
	<body>Interesting co-production between Spain and Great Britain, very competent from the industrial point of view. That is, a frenetic montage, a superb soundtrack of Roque Baños, beautiful photography, and an estimable address by Daniel Monzón, which gives a quick pace to the captivating story.But is that its development is, in General, uneven. Its first third is very good, we will know the main characters, and the abnormal events, strange suicides, confront us with power and dramatic intensity. This part is very good and hooked to the most demanding Viewer.However, later events is slow enough, although the interest is not low, because the climax of mystery and intrigue argues intelligently. There are also some scenes, such as the taxi, excellent and very difficult to shoot, that startle.The best is in its final third, with everything that happens in "Caves of hell". Here the pace becomes to shoot, with moments adrenalíticos and a really notable formal reslución.Perhaps what most rechine is know to what relates all which is leif-motif of this great little monster superbly played by the almost octogenarian David Kelly, a very veteran actor who has perhaps managed the interpretation of his life here. When this leif-motiv is known, I think that you know a little, that is exaggerated as causes for achieving its goal. Anyway, is just my opinion clear.In short, "The Kovak box" is a very interesting film, which is very well shot and has genuine interest. A film genre that is really worthwhile despite its imperfections.</body>
