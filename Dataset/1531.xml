	<summary>A masterpiece to be seen with all your senses.</summary>
	<body>Frank Miller was the recorded blood battle of Thermopylae and fire since his childhood saw the film "The lion of Sparta" (The 300 Spartans, 1962), which was one of his major influences of childhood, by what where deemed qualified to do so, decided to provide its own interpretation of that fact in a graphic novel that I recommend strongly reading. Zack Snyder, where is his second film after "Dawn of the dead" composed here his best work, leaving the same footprint left on a Robert Rodriguez with his "Sin City" server, translate, in real image and if a shred of problem the world of the comic (or graphic novel for scholars) to the big screenZack Snyder succeeds, leaving all the characters and the environment's role in a film difficult to forget, and that we like to watch over and over again.The tape never falters, conversely, the almost 2 hours of footage are an absolute pleasure for all the senses; mention separate interpretations of Gerard Butler (great as King Leon√≠das), the unknown bellisima Lena Headey, the always remembered as "Faramir" David Wenham, as well as Dominic West as the perfidious Theron, almost I forget "bellismo" Rodrigo Santoro with a make-up reminiscent of the mythical Ru-paul. In addition highlight the band Sonora of Tyler Bates, brilliant in its composition, although in some moments have epic sonorities reminiscent of "Gladiator" or "Trojan" and is the shadow of both tape is long for this kind of film.Digital effects on the tape are almost one character, since the film has been shot in BlueScreen, then adding the "yellow" brightness of the comic, as blood, that inhabits the screen giving that fictional and dramatic air that looks so well in the patido seats.In short, a masterpiece that it should look with all the senses.</body>
