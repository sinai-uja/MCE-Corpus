	<summary>Stallone has returned. Rambo has become. Who can not enjoy the news? Who can not enjoy before a movie of the old? So violent as amusing. Stallone is for awhile.</summary>
	<body>Against all odds, Sylvester Stallone will turn into a craftsman of those who no longer have. I say it's against all odds because from Copland, was not the perfect film, have spent more than ten years and Sly seemed in danger of extinction as their countrymen gener-action. And became Rocky Balboa, an emotional tribute to one of the most beloved characters of the film.With the return of the Boxer were many who took a surprise fat, but bigger still is the return of another classic but much darker character: John Rambo.En this fourth adventure, less than 90 minutes, return to the cinema to see one of those movies that are not already filmed and leaving in diapers for example, the disappointing and also fourth adventure of another old John: McClane. Now Rambo, which remains locked inside and outside all the shit that is found in the world, must rescue a group of volunteers who travel to Burma to cooperate on humanitarian mission. If the hallmarks of exceeding the Stallone classic saga is lost in the jungle 4.0, in Rambo its director and protagonist (and screenwriter) gives a punch on the table and scream so loudly a here I am, let's smear of blood that can be seen with taste.Because there is so much blood that he may be the most violent of the four, with violations, episode in the film torture and killings as not we saw from the frika of the Cannon, everything with an enviable narrative pulse in which no time for the Midlands in a colossal all or nothing that it leaves a huge climax to remember of the pre. An exercise of nostalgia and style that should not take a joke. Rambo has become.</body>
