	<summary>Future deliveries which will hopefully have a better script, since the subject of the actors (all just middling, being generous) seems untouchable, and a director better than Tim Story that dowry of more pulse to a series that deserves better luck.</summary>
	<body>My level of excitement prior to the premiere was low. Neither the simplistic posters and trailers had me you forget of the disappointing part.Therefore it is surprising that in the end, the disaster of a priori more interesting films such as "Spider-Man 3" or "Pirates of the Caribbean 3", "silly" entertainment of the summer ends "the fantastic four and Silver Surfer" (Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer).It is not that the film is a wonder, or a lot less. It is full of bad jokes, missed situations, several ñoñerías and, in general, all deficiencies resulting from writing a script designed for children and adolescents rather than for adults. But may not be denied the fact that it is entretenidilla and helps pass the time (hence my description of "silly entertainment").Perhaps the improvement on the previous film has to do with the presence of Silver Surfer, a complex and interesting character is the best of the film and who has been known to give that mystical air that characterizes him in the comics. I have to say that, as a follower of these characters, I'd have been able to enjoy more than Galactus but I understand that they reserve this option for future deliveries.Future deliveries which will hopefully have a better script, since the subject of the actors (all just middling, being generous) seems untouchable, and a director better than Tim Story that dowry of more pulse to a series that deserves better luck.</body>
