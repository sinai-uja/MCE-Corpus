	<body>Some authors after seeing jeopardize their careers decide to return to the cinema of its principles. The COEN brothers wore two comedies well below expectations of a few filmmakers always well recognized.Intolerable Cruelty and THE LADYKILLERS meant an alarming decline in the talent demonstrated on previous occasions, especially in film noir that provided on the principles of his filmography with titles as significant as easy blood, death among the flowers and more recently the memorable Fargo. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a happy reunion with his early works discussed, a return to the roots of violence dry with disturbing characters embodied by brilliant actors.Javier Barden sicario seems you can repeat nomination to the oscar after earlier that night falls, the winner of the Academy Award TOMMI LEE JONES for the fugitive shows sobriety that is customary. Accompanied by two other large actors of always grateful presence in the faces of JOSH BROLIN who we saw recently in PLANET TERROR and the great WOODY HARRELSON with great performances in his filmography with ex officio assassins or the series CHEERS.All of them in full State of grace in a perfect film full of strength, with excellent dialogues, perfect in all technical aspects, in a brilliantly constructed script that provides us with the return to the mastery of some great as always will be the Coen brothers.</body>
