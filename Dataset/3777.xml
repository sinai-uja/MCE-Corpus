	<body>Based on a true story, Chris Cooper, Ryan Phillipe and Laura Linney put face and decent performances to a tranquil but cold, intense but sad film. O´Neill (Phillipe), young FBI that want to become agent is responsible for monitoring a transcript of the Bureau: Robert Hanssen (Cooper).A little conventional espionage thriller. Its great appeal lies in the interpretation of Chris Cooper as a cold, calculating, expert character in detecting lies and be a great believer with a straight and very family life. All these virtues despistan the young and discovers the real reason for which you have signed up: check if it is true it passes information from national security to Russians.Far from the stereotypes of the spies, superheroes, the film shows us a FBI as a matter of official, delicate and vulnerable, in which even the most expert is capable of making mistakes and that to unmask a traitor are recruited almost more agent than to other more dangerous operations. They are very human, far from what we are accustomed.A movie that loads your excitement in a topsy-turvy character who constantly distracted and puts to the test the improvisation of the young agent to unmask him. A thriller that surpasses the offices of labour and arrives at home, the family, the married life.An intense thriller without resorting to dramatic camera movements or to special effects. Very earthly, very credible, very realistic.</body>
