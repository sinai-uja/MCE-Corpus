	<body>If there is something that sells today in our society, it is morbid, and there are all the pseudo-programas television whose sole purpose is to bring to light the more morbid stories to feed the greed of humans by the rough events. As a result, is almost unbelievable but I say applauded that a fact so dramatic as the murder of Adrienne Shelly has not been used as promotional tool of the Camarera.Desde here we reiterate our most sincere appreciation to the Fox Spain Press Department, for not playing with sensationalism and pain alien in order to increase the excitement around one of his movies. Having said that, it should be noted that the waitress is a comedy with some melodramatic and romantic touches too cloying. History is intentionally left halfway between drama and comedy, although the end result ends up being very soft and sentimentaloide. The script has profound ups and downs, and the characters that fall friendly too reach the ridiculous, are poorly written and less developed. Intended, in addition, use the culinary elements to give the film a magical atmosphere, but this also fails, and stays far away from major films such as like water for Chocolate and A touch of cinnamon. The interpretations are correct, although it is noteworthy that Keri Russell sounds as a possible candidate for the Oscar for work so correct as bland.The waitress is an excessively loose romantic comedy that lies closer to the fussiness of Chocolat than of the magical realism of like water for Chocolate. History, neither excited nor makes laugh, incurred on numerous topics, and its end is more predictable, if it has value to withstand such an indigestion of sweet till the last consequences.</body>
