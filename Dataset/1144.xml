	<body>The Kovak box has in common with "The silence of the lambs" the villain captures a dangerous role. Although Timothy Hutton has the privilege to save the girl, it is actually the villain, Kovak, who quite the history, is he who commands, even in the end. The villain is a bad caricaturizable, a somewhat limited bad with this desire to be a character in a book, but has a disturbing point when he himself wants to be the bad guy. Daniel Monz√≥n has given a real tumble to Pirandello and Unamuno "fog". The character speaks with its Narrator, and does not conform to force him to write his final. Each time I like the flat virtuous sequence. The girl is in the shower and heard the fatal melody; the camera leaves the room through the window, descend to the bar without a court and follow the waiter suddenly turns so let's see how the same girl has fallen on the terrace. One feels crushed by the idea, by the images, and if you want, also by the trick of shooting such takes uncut.It's a good thriller. It is told with a clean deck, unmarked, in which the director is taking cards and more and more amazing, with an ending that is not deflated as a bluff. The outcome is characterising, tells the protagonist that he cannot be an observer. Monsoon, like so many others, has wanted to make a thriller at the height of Hollywood, and must say that at no time did the ridiculous, which is much to say. Watching movies like this one does not lose hope that the Spanish film begins to take himself seriously.</body>
