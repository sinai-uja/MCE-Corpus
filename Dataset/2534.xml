	<body>"Again we get the friendly green OGRE wrapped in another adventure surrounded by his entourage, consisting of ass and cat with boots.""Shrek the third" low level reached with previous proposals, the story suffers some ups and downs resented the overall structure, but even so, Chris Miller shows very interesting parts, such as recruitment by charming in the tavern of the "stripped", or bad very bad of classic tales, or its presentation as a café theatre actor. The dream of Shrek becoming father, the subplot of donkey and puss in boots, the deathbed of the King, and some other sequences make approaching up the rooms to see this film not in vain, but the more demanding will feel a bit disappointed with this adventure.The effects are still roaring, managing to create some very good kingdoms, and some put into scenes by way of Theatre (final Act) very achieved, so in that aspect encandilarán viewers.The soundtrack this formed by Harry Gregson-Williams songs composed for the occasion, as well as a number of songs which complement this work.Ultimately, the originality and freshness was "Shrek" we have a very distant place with regard to this third installment.</body>
