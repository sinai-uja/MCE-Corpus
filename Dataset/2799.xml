	<body>What a surprise! It was only rumours of this movie, and the book of P.D.James have not read, with which it had no very clear with what I was going to find. And I find a good movie with a brilliant and chilling atmosphere. The England of the 2027 the world towards destruction, domination of the most overwhelming, militarized and xenophobic right, is terrifying &#8230;. and horribly credible, might not be so distant future. The scene in which the refugee camp you completely surrounds.The story is very good, original (although that one may think it is another apocalyptic) and surprising, with a component of mysticism, in what less relevant is the earlier and the later, what is really important is the situation, not the facts.Clive Owen is the perfect actor for the role of Theo, which is great, and the performance is necessary. The role of Julianne Moore surprised me (appears as headliners). The side are luxury, but what you can expect if you have in your template to Michael Caine as an old hippie.All this aderezamos it with a good address, makes nearly two hours of film you balls and pass in an instant. The scene of the bus is wonderful.In short, totally recommended, a science fiction, not as science and perhaps not fiction. You love all those who like films of near future, &#8220; without naves &#8221;.And the end, I loved it.</body>
