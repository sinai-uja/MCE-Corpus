	<body>Pop cinema, but seriously. "Matador", written and directed by Richard Shepard is one of the best of last season. And it is for several reasons. It has a marvelous pair of actors, with Pierce Brosnan brutally funny, wonderful, in the best performance of his career and the always effective Greg Kinnear in another emotional role of "looser".The story is original: a Hitman (Brosnan) "burned", as the last Zidane, and a businessman whom life no smiles especially (Kinnear) try out of a crisis by the loss of his son by his wife (the fantastic Hope Davis), known in the bar of a hotel of Mexico. (almost as "Lost in Translation")Since then forms including a fun (and freak) friendship.Pierce Brosnan leaves Bond the ballast and desmelena in a hilarious composition (including spoken English) accompanied by half of the odd couple, Kinnear.La photograph by David Tattersall ("The Green Mile" or the last three episodes of "Star Wars") is impeccable, with colors that are out of the screen and that seem taken from a movie by Almodovar (like the title), and the soundtrack is tremendous (begins with The Jam and ends with The Killers), although the score of Rolfe Kent reminds "Forrest Gump".Very funny, mounted of fear, with a lot of guideline posters most chik and an elaborate plot that takes not more than 90 minutes of good cinema.Highly recommended, the couple Brosnan/Kinnear, historical.A phrase: "does perhaps the men of success do not have blood on their hands.?"</body>
