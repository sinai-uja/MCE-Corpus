	<body>Some films become cult by a particular fact or much less for the quality that can offer in this case is null. Known in Spain with the title of aggression in the House of terror this film was the first to record digital video in addition to also mean the first commissioning of a work for the direct to video.This precedent gives a minimum thread's popularity in the debut of director and actors that did not work in any other product. Typical narrative of owned houses where adolescents of little brain are massacred in a few special effects of nursery, virtually amateur performances, a very poor staging in a by-product can do some grace to this cluster of absurdities. More that anything has its value to collectors.</body>
