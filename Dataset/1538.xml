	<summary>Sequel to the remake of the Japanese film the curse and a clear example of how to do a bad sequel without imagination and repeating the same pattern over and over again.</summary>
	<body>After the events in the first part, this new movie will show us three lines argue them one of them has to do with our protagonist, Sarah Michelle Gellar as his sister will come to fetch her to take her home, but will be stuck in the same problem her to investigate what happened to him and enter the cursed House. On the other hand we have a couple of girls young students who decide to spend a joke to another third making entering the House and make a macabre game, as it will end up not being more real than they anticipate. And finally the third storyline where we have an American family whose members begin to behave in a strange and aggressive.The film is nothing more than a succession of scenes of scares and deaths, over and over again we see some of the protagonist being harassed by the pale ghost of the child, the mother or both at the same time until that just dying. There are some successful scare, it must be said, but it is that as each scene is practically equal to the previous average film already they tired. Although they then attempt to sneak us some plot the sister of previous protagonist and his research to find out that it has happened but is just fanning in five minutes and really nothing fits what tells us. And then it ends with a final which saw the League towards time but that they stop to explain with flashbacks is not that our poor intelligence not captures it.It is high time that the director of the originals and their remakes goodbye of a saga that no longer has much to say and is the only thing that is going to get bored.</body>
