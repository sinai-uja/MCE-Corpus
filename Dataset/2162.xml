	<body>Since "Shrek" collapsed the ticket offices of half the world, with its original way to destroy the fairy tales, more than one producer, has tried to, thanks to the animation, follow the play, with dubious success (e.g. "Hoodwinked" which premiered last year), and others like this that brings us today, with greater or lesser success, repeating already seen prior situations.Is to the downside of "Once upon a time." not only is the (little elaborate) plot but simplistic animation, that it is not diminishing, noooo to vaaa, but seeing work of people such as Pixar or Dreamworks, one sees in this film a "I want and I can not", well, so a tape made with 4? and with peanuts (I mean strange "Cries in the corridor"), most attracts my attention, one of the few positive points that I give is that at least his dubbing is not full of famosetes of middling.In V.O. have the voices of Sarah Michelle Gellar, Freddie Prinze Jr., and Sigourney Weaver. Incidentally, the stepmother reminds me waaaaay to the latter, seems to be the only one to which the animators have had some consideration, as the main character to look like Sarah Michelle, reminds me more Winona Ryder, and given his bad reputation in Hollywood, that is have a bit of bad milk.Ah! by the way, is another tape must be added to the list of films of quasi-ridiculous duration, which is that, in an hour and 15 minutes, little more can be counted not true?Anyway, to sum up, it won't be to the history of the cinema of animation (eso no doubt), but, once more, drag the kids (and parents, uncles, cousins, all accompanying them together) to cinema what more can we do? Suffer her with patience, there is another.</body>
