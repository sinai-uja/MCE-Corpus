	<body>Flags of our fathers tells the story of the famous photo obtained and used as propaganda in World War II by the United States against the Japanese in the island of Iwo Jima.Vaya ahead which is a good movie. The war is very well filmed, in the style of the great opening sequence of Spielberg (film producer) in saving soldier Ryan. At the same time, the part that 3 of those soldiers who managed to put the flag on the top of the top are taken on tour to raise funds is counting. To me these flashbacks did not work me at all. I think that some of the personajesno are introduced well when they are then mentioned them and you do not remember a who is named.I always have the feeling that there is still half with Eastwood. Half have brilliant dialogues. Halfway in the criticism that starts but doesn't break at all. Halfway in the emotions. And in this case it gets footage, becoming boring at times.Of course, it has notable things, which I summarize the section, the best.It will please many, but to me I just do not convince.</body>
