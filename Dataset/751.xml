	<body>Martin Scorsese has always felt predilection for movies in which the mobsters, gangsters and policemen settled their differences by dint of submachine gun, as it already expressed in Casino and more recently in Gangs of New York. He is a man who likes well elaborate frames, and so not repaired in the footage, that rarely drop their creations of two hours. In addition, this former seminarian has the extraordinary ability to surround himself with la flor y nata of interpretation, also realize that Scorsese is a director capable of taking the best of each one of them. The departed is a new version of a hongkonesa film of some years ago, and while it maintains the spirit of the original, the American has endowed it that personal touch that has always characterized their productions. The film tells the story of a police infiltrated the mafia, a mafioso infiltrated the police and all that this entails. With his usual moral ambiguity, the director makes us see that black is neither black nor white is white at all: or the police are Saints nor mafia demons FoPs and narcissistic full of evil. DiCaprio, Wahlberg and Sheen scratch at high level; Jack Nicholson, master among masters deserves special mention and is able to make good a film he only. The musical themes of the Rollings and Pink Floyd (the latter played by Roger Waters and Van Morrison) despite the end result. It would not be strange that after five nominations, Scorsese got finally the Academy, nor Jack added another to his collection. Brilliant product that reminds us that there is still room for quality in the current film, and that this need not be at odds with the entertainment. Brilliant.</body>
