	<body>"Arizona, 1874." Link Jones, former gunman dedicated to banditry, is today a man regenerated and happily married. "So much so, that the community in which he lives he has commissioned hire a new teacher, for what Link has embarked on a journey by train equipped with six hundred dollars".Excellent western which, in his day, was misunderstood by his plot ambiguity, as well as for its violence, bursts and quite stark and cruel. But it is a good film, strong, dynamic, Yes, somewhat dark and particular. The characters are never a piece and all have a dark past. Scathing and acerados dialogues, embaucadora photography and, above all, an unusual staging for what is forced if it is projected by television, full screen format, something that almost never happens. Well Gary Cooper and especially Lee j. Cobb, in an abject, huge role physically and as an actor.</body>
