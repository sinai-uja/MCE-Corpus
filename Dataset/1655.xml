	<summary>Oscarizada Scorsese film about double agents everywhere. A great script that loses force by a loving trio, long that the film is made and a final that inferior to the rest of the tape. Recommended with reservations.</summary>
	<body>It is the sport and with that name, I thought I was a sport that now to all they infiltrated them to play. Well, some other things they infiltrate and climb the ports that give Vertigo. Anyway, this of the departed is Scorsese, which finally gave the Oscar of the Academy (as the Goya, but Yankee version) last. Already is it would merit the kid, but to me, I finished killing, not.The film is a police infiltrated a mafia gang and a mafioso infiltrated the police. One trafficking catch to the mafia, while the other not caught him, as well as hamper police work. And thus elapses the thing with surprises everywhere. I am not telling you more than you know very well.Well, the plot of the film very well, is based on an idea by infiltrators on both sides which makes us see the shit that moves everywhere and the pring√° you are others. The result is a tad long, with a strange loving trio that subtract pace and does too (to say nothing). The end I didn't like, and is that Scorsese touch is not of my taste of never. The actors curran it much and totally give the paste, as well as the setting. But I did not finish like the movie, perhaps for so long, perhaps by the horrible final taste.In short, oscarizada Scorsese film about double agents everywhere. A great script that loses force by a loving trio, long that the film is made and a final that inferior to the rest of the tape. Recommended with reservations.</body>
