	<body>Napoleón dynamite, Gigolo and Finch join together to play baseball against children aged twelve. With that argument, most scholars won't see this movie or on television a morning drinking beer with nothing to do, but see you where, I I I passed big. Dennis Dugan, director of the Happy Gilmore enorrme and other Sandlerianos vehicles (Adam Sandler, refers, that it produces here), as well as the misunderstood and hilarious Evil Woman (three idiots and a witch.) Her I bought on dvd. (I'm a freak?) He gives his personal touch. (that does it.) (Beyond the Farrelly) this barrabasada is intended to be, and I think that a (deserved) tribute succeeds, to the real freak.I laughed my seeing how the great John Lovitz (still I am laughing at his ANTHOLOGICAL Hitlerian gag of rats to the race) gives life to a billionaire with too much free time. I really liked. Not everything will be qualité. I give you a 7.PD: Nick Swardson, multifóbico brother of the character of David Spade, a discovery. We'll see soon accompanying Chief Ferrell in Blades of Glory.</body>
