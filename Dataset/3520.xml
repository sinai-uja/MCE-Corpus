	<summary>Nice comedy of Woody Allen.</summary>
	<body>Very nice comedy of Woody Allen, who returns for the charters, more or less, his first creative phase, when what they cared most was to laugh the Viewer.Here it succeeds well, thanks to a clever script, which is not to be the eighth wonder of the world, have them much better, but that makes everything work perfectly, with nothing that chirríe sobre or missing. Well, perhaps there a moment, one of the recent dialogues between Allen and Johansson, who is a tad long, but when one realizes, is passed to the next scene, so it is barely perceptible.The dialogues, once again, are great, with such outputs of tone and verbal incontinence that characterizes the characters embodied by the same Woody. He is very gesticuloso, true, but has always been so. But the important thing is what he says and there shows, once again, the wit, the spark and the grace to give and give.Comic situations, even though they are not to have, does function as a watch, giving rise to touches of intrigue and suspense, although always under the sieve of good humor.In short, a pretty fun movie of Woody Allen, who did what they wanted, as it should be always, because the viewer never should tell a creator must create what. What can do is criticize it. I say this because many people has criticized Allen for having made this movie good. Up there could get the public you tell a direct / screenwriter who must shoot or not!.In fn, which is less Woody's work? Minor compared to what?</body>
