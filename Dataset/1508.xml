	<summary>Monster, Macguffin, lie M M m. I not finish very well understand the critical and commercial impact of a film that does not reach you the height of your shoes to the best examples of the fantasy genre.</summary>
	<body>Said Alfred Hitchcock if you start big, with a large Boom!, the public will not stand up seat and them you will have for all footage looking at the screen.However, Bong Joon-ho has done just that: a big Boom! and later. After a succession of nonsense about a dysfunctional family (and go) and anything but a monster-movie.Term not understand very well the impact of criticism and public of a film that does not reach you the height of the shoes to the best samples of the latest fantasy genre, either The Descent, or the hills have eyes or film of Rob Zombie.Y I'm not worth the "is that it is not a movie monsters to use" because on the cover, among other pearls, appears "the best film of monsters of history or was first shark and then Alien". Show me. Shark and Alien are two of the best movies of horror of the history of the cinema and The Host, to begin with, does not play in the same League. This is humor of the absurd, which I think is very appropriate for a movie about a vendor of matches, but not a movie Monster.Specific: Yes may be humor (you must have, the movies of monsters have to be, above all, fun) in this type of movies, but is that maybe I do not understand the yellow humor, I do not know.Ah, the monster, by the way, does not exist for the other characters, more concerned of the virus (another Macguffin) or contaminated family.I leave for the final final, with random deaths for those present at the time of the amarillo.¿Tanta smoke Grill for how it ends the move? I was more afraid seeing Rosa Spain in hands to work.</body>
