	<body>Spanish Cinema finds its shelter in the television program "Film de Barrio", that every week brings us the newest of those years in which Alfredo Landa was a ligón persecutor of Swedish. With stop or Carmen Seville, the essence of the program remains intact, and brings us juicy movies that we could not see in any other way. Viva cinema of neighborhood and the mother that bore.The film is about Benito, a sad guarda-agujas you want to climb on the bandwagon of the Western films that were recorded at the time in Almería. The designs of the destination make it achieve its objective and there, with tenacity, luck and Iberian male extract is getting a hole in this crazy world of the western.Saturday afternoon, get out of the NAP and get the fabric to see film of neighborhood is a Russian roulette which not everyone dares to play. I did and I took this one, rather than one of Joselito. I have to admit that the movie I liked, rather than die of laughter, but I had as a dwarf. On the one hand, Alfredo Landa, which is of the finest actors that we have been able to have throughout history. And I say that seriously. The deployment of media is doing here is spectacular, always limited by the script. We also have other greats like José Sacristán or Chanquete (before he died) that has a tremendous momentazo. Not to miss the scene where wall deer speaks.In short, the argument is pretty weak, but as entertainment for a Saturday afternoon movie is very appropriate. And for all the family. Alfredo Landa runaway.</body>
