	<body>"The night of the sunflowers" is a film made up of twists. The good twists are a very stimulating rhetorical element, because they involve the participation of the spectator. Each spectator constantly anticipates the paths that can be followed from the plot, does it so because, without knowing it, every viewer is an expert in film, and an authority on the issue of gender. When a turn is made the viewer has to recapitulate and realize that their assumptions were wrong, the author has changed, without that you will notice, the gender, theme, the focus, the protagonist or another element. Someone should write an essay on the turns, because we like it or not, the twists have its rules, and I suspect that Sánchez-Cabezudo has skipped a very fat. You can not start a film with a feast of Hannibal Lecter and then turn our attention to a student topic as a teenager who wants to pretend it is not. There are issues too strong that impress too, and issues that require too much inner peace to mix them in a tortilla. Sánchez-Cabezudo begins his film with a soulless rapist, but it's a distraction, a decorative element, what I wanted was actually lecture on the obstruction of justice. The error is conception, fat, but correctable in future films, leaves behind style, love for details, and a pulse sign that they talk about a good Narrator.</body>
