	<body>Turn of the screw to Phillip k. Dick, science fiction and Rotoscoping (it wasn't anything new for him, see Walking life) was the feature of Linklater waited with eagerness for lovers of the genre, because the original story, adapted by the own Linklater, was the perfect excuse to use this animation technique. This section meets far, the viewer feel from the first minute the same paranoia and effects than the characters. He hallucinates. Also, the main characters are interpreted paranoid junkies by? former junkies paranoid? Another section that complies with a promise: everytime Winona, Woody and Robert agree on scene, the film won many integers. Why is so it fails the rest: the plot. I thought, while watching the movie, they had done so, for example, Michael Mann shooting the thriller pure and simple. By using the technical rotoscoped, special effects had not been a significant outlay of money. In fact, none of the actors took their usual salary, the budget the film is eight million euros. It's indie film to percent, forget about action or persecutions, this is a film of people talking. Rather, it is a film people talking much. A pity instead of taking the path of the police investigation and the game of cat and mouse (that lesson of cinema which gives Scorsese in The Departed, by the way) take the coolest of new age philosophy. It is a film that is going to have a very short life if it is projected in inadequate theaters. Refrain palomiteros and other search engines fun evasion: peden staying asleep or leave the room. You aloan warned. Interesting and, at times, very funny with that couple of junkies Downey Jr. and which jodió you life to the Turkey of Grizzly man.</body>
