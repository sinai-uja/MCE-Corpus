	<summary>Irresistible (though perhaps should be called unbearable)</summary>
	<body>Ann Turner is one of those directors with little filmography behind him that is well accompanied by some heavyweight industry. Otherwise it is incomprehensible that it will count for one of his early work with actors of the prestige of Sam Nelly and above all, Susan Sarandon. So far it has shown a rather limited talent and his films seem more TV movies than genuine film productions. And is that Irresistible is a by-product that not even the talent of its protagonists manages to rescue of mediocrity, and the only thing really irresistible in this film are the desire which you enter of leave the room shortly after start. It is a kind of drama with a touch of suspense, or upside down, nor could tell it exactly. The plot revolves around a woman who thinks that intends the companion of her husband working to stay with his house, his car and even her husband. The anguish experienced on the widespread belief that is paranoid represent the central focus of the film. The tempo cansino and monotonous, joined a virtually flat script make Irresistible a vulgar movie that surely will pass without penalty or glory through the charts, and that no one will remember few hours after seeing. Susan Sarandon, which seems to have fallen into disgrace and lacks lately to major studios, having to settle for minor like this productions deserves special mention. Perhaps the most appropriate site for Irresistible is the shelf of video clubs; But yes, well cornered, lest someone be confused and her rent. Although each is free to throw the money as it sees fit.</body>
