	<body>Endearing though something little co-produced film between Lebanon and Francia.Y when I say little is not because do not like, that he liked in the past Donostia (2007) International Film Festival, winning the popular and prestigious awards of youth and the public, but because, really, it is not very good to say, at least not as good as they could indicate such awards.But it is heart-warming, is full of sympathetic characters, nearly all of them positive, and the script plays several important issues, all of them relating to the situation of women in Lebanon and in the Arab world in general.Plays the theme of the liberation of women, of their difficulties to find work, of its place in the macho society, with its outdated but rooted customs, such as who should get Virgin to marriage.Drama and humor combine well, although the movie as I say is somewhat scarce in the technical section.A nice picture that hooked to the public. Something will be, I'm not saying that no, although to my me disappointed somewhat, sobre all because I saw the last day of the Festival, precisely in the "Winner of the award to the youth and public" section. And of course, if you see after learning that has won these two prestigiosísimos Awards, you stay a piece.</body>
