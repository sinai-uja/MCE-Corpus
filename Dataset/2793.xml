	<body>On the desktop of the channel + I found this comedy (one more), light, starring a cast of actresses quasi unknown and where especially noted the presence of America Ferrera fashionable in USA now for the adaptation of "Betty la fea" and hit the jump to the movies with "truth women have curves".The argument and its approach is curious, although note too its transfer of novel to screenplay, indeed, that this kind of books of "separate stories" and that both like girls, here materializes in a bland movie but a "handful" of $ giving rise to a sequel with almost the same cast which grossed at the box office.Attempts to, in some way have certain doses of drama, but become a little muggy, and although in all the houses are cooked beans, or, rather, problems have all, here it seems that at some moments the misfortunes seem Prime is (and that way) with the protagonists, without separating summer fresh comedieta drama.In short, although there are who branded it's 8th wonder of the world, to my found me "one of many" forgettable film style.</body>
