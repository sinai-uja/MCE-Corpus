	<summary>Film about the sexual of a strange group of New Yorkers and everyday problems. Not is if you intend to shock, but after 6 or 7 fellatio starts to do boring. Shocked on the basis of sex begins to be heavy. Moreover, little or nothing.</summary>
	<body>The world of the autofellatio is coto private men, for obvious reasons. Who do not ever thought of in the well would be able to do oral relief so that Yes? I since I saw this film, I lost any interest they might have had. By the way, this actor, after this filming, what kind of roles offered? I do not think it comes out in a cameo with the teletubbies, not.The film is about newyorkinos which are fatally. On the one hand, a sex therapist who has never had an orgasm, which meets a dominant Mistress dealing with the help. On the other hand, a gay couple who want to give vidilla their relations getting more people to the rejoicing and gloating. On the other hand, a neighbor spy them and gives the zambomba. And all are finished concentrating on Shortbus, a social club where people go to a sexually inhibitions.You can call me old or short-sighted, but a film that begins with a type throwing the issue in the mouth after autofelacionarse, seems to me to be cinema. The script of the film is to me a little weird with people with problems that I do not think too everyday, at least the way of raising them and fix them. The argument really not contributed me almost nothing, with the exception of "know" a little more about the world of gay sexuality. But hey, this has no feet or head. Possibly should be read before the statements by the director to be able to focus.In short, film about sexual of a strange group of New Yorkers and everyday problems. Not is if you intend to shock, but after 6 or 7 fellatio starts to do boring. Shocked on the basis of sex begins to be heavy. Moreover, little or nothing.kisses.</body>
