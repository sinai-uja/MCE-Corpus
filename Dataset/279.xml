	<summary>Disappointment. The tape falls sharply, they put aside the heroic Superman theme and takes the part of love story</summary>
	<body>All ballots had to be one of the "taquillazos" of the year 2006, all options to make a film that will love me, to make me dream, who would be willing to revisit over and over again, but. After the joy that had been in the room (it was even applauding the mythical John Williams Superman theme), the tape falls sharply, they put aside the heroic Superman theme and takes the part of "love story" (boy returns to see girl, who is with another.).And nothing, unfortunately is what it seems, the film tilda boring, slow (too much), and very simplistic, one expects a final auction that never arrives and the sour taste will gradually desvaratando in the personality of the Viewer.Note positive interpretation of Brandon Routh, who sometimes comes to "imitate" Christopher Reeve, and the always great Kevin Spacey, mixing the best Lex Luthor with small "lashes" of Joker "Batman", ah! The Score of John Ottman also sensational, mixed in some moments with the theme of John Williams. Finally, you had to listen to the air of disappointment floating in the room at the end of the projection.</body>
