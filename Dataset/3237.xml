	<summary>Intesante film of fantastic intrigue, which as it happens with some snowfall, fails curdle.</summary>
	<body>Quite interesting on paper, it contains all the elements to make it a pleasant, very entertaining tape. However, it is not so.It has, as I say, very attractive cinematographic elements for the general public: intrigue, thriller elements, anytime a touch of fantasy but the thing not curdled conveniently, I believe that because of the inexperience of its director.The idea is good, no doubt, but its resolution images becomes a product without much force, rather slow, and stands almost entirely in the remarkable interpretation of Guy Pearce, who composed his difficult character with style, mixing the sobriety with dramatic violence (the fullness of his obsession). Therein lie all the frames and it is the soul of the history.But if it were not for him, the shebang, I am afraid, is come down relatively easily.This is so because all distant and something cold, except for the final part, where all House in the determination, the road will finally choose the protagonist. This part is very human and contains hassta tenderness, not exempt of melancholy. But to achieve this we have to follow a story that for the sake of the screenplay is something dark and not get motivate in excess, rather on the contrary, makes the viewer follow everything calmly, without azorar it, without feeling more than mere human curiosity about how Earth will end all. And ends rather disappointingly. I refer to the last sentence you hear. A sentence that concludes a story that is more than clear that it should have been given much more than Yes.In summary, which does not bored, has some good dialogues and something (little) humor, as well as an excellent Guy Pearce, but am not convinced and very well can be disappoint.</body>
