	<summary>Boring, long and heavy film proposal on the attacks of September 11, 2001.</summary>
	<body>'World Trade Center' found me, and I will say without mincing words in the language and regardless of the topic dealing with the film, a tostonazo unbearably boring, long and heavy. Your pace falls miserably from the collapse of the South Tower (to the quarter of an hour of having started, go). Does not create in any way nor a glimmer of interest in almost all of their footage.Now, intense and emotional is a while (and have not found me much less a "americanada"). Highlight the collapses of the twin towers, which are a bloody agony. And I think a real tribute (regardless of what I have come to bore the film) to all the victims and to all those police officers, firefighters, military. In short, to all those true heroes who gave all their forces in the rescue efforts.The cast is simply correct, although I would like to highlight Michael Pe√±a (Will Jimeno), Maggie Gyllenhaal (Allison Jimeno) and the always radiant Maria Bello (Donna McLoughlin), which I would love some of them will take a nomination to the Oscar next year.</body>
