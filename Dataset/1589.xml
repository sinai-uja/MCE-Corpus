	<summary>The story, unfortunately does not give much, and is quite linear. Palomitera, in the broadest sense of the word.</summary>
	<body>Umpteenth adaptation of a Marvel comic book on screen, which boasts an excellent deployment of special effects (as curious point that this film thought to occur in the 1980s, even there are some nice make-up tests by the network, but had not as advanced as the now effects).Nicolas Cage and Eva Mendes (the latter more pneumatic than ever), give life to the protagonists, Cage, as always, online, providing just enough and little else, Mendes showing her body serrano (seems sponsored by Wonderbra), on the other hand we have to Peter Fonda, and Sam Elliott, who begins to be usual in this type of film.The story, unfortunately does not give much, and is fairly linear, it is true that for those who have followed the adventures of the Ghostrider the world of the comic will be some things it family (including his alter-ego in Western), but certainly not will go down in the history of the cinema, since it is pure entertainment swallows popcorn and coca cola.The soundtrack highlights the theme "Riders in the Sky", famous for being one of the most mythical songs of Western film. The rest of the issues, as always (common in this type of film) sugarcane music.By the way why noses will not be behavior in public places a subject to study at school? Every day I like less going to the movies at times where the "pipiolos" can go to berrear with your colleagues.</body>
