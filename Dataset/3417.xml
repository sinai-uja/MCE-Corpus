	<body>Hilarious comedy with a fund that could not be more dramatic. But Tom Fernandez, thanks to a few interpreters in State of grace, get that the Viewer is laugh it at all times to account of the vicissitudes of a few quite streams characters, with more flaws in his life than a shotgun in fair, but also with overflowing vitality and sympathy.This is achieved with a lot of script, which does not lose face at any time to the various dramas that compose the human mosaic swarming by the tape, but get us'm with them, and at the end they love.Moments of great tenderness, where friendship is the current currency, even if it must pass various tests throughout the footage.No, it is not that the argument is credible, it is rather plausible, although there is no who creates various events, for example the change that gives one of the friends, the "first officer". But Tom Fernandez makes to us what we traguemos with potatoes given its positivity and sympathy.The truth is that you spend very well and leaves a superb taste, inter alia due to excellent performances and a script with great humanity and a beautiful music.</body>
