	<body>Having seen films such as "Hero", "House of flying daggers" or "The curse of the Golden Flower", one expects to enter a magical world when he attends a new Chinese epic adventure. "However, the new bid director Chen Kaige and the team that shot"Dragon and Tiger"left me with a bitter taste in the mouth.""The promise" it mixes the fantasy of a fairy tale, with the epic of Eastern battles and the romanticism of the rose novel, but precisely the error of treating all these issues together has resulted in a confusing and history too convoluted, closing at the end of absurd form some of the raised plots.The beauty of his aesthetic loses much of its charm by the abuse of digital effects, causing laughter in several combat scenes. Incompressible is that in the XXI century is put aside important details (such as the arms of the protagonists) for digital technology. Even the soundtrack weakens in some scenes of the film, as for example when come to large orchestrations in intimate moments of the film.The only thing that saves the film from a total disaster are the good definition of the four main characters, confronted by love and ambition, notably great interpretation of the actor Jang Dong-Kun, and, of course, the rojiblanco colorful which highlights all the time.In short, "The promise" is a pretentious proposal you want to cover too many topics and abandons the simple beauty of its predecessors to embark on the digital world.</body>
