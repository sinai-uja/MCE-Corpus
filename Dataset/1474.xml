	<summary>Lynch has been a little bit assembling nightmares, as in dreams, lacking any consistency. Is this film a bullshit? I do not know, is subjective? is a painting by Miró bullshit that would make your five-year-old nephew?  Yourself.</summary>
	<body>If you ask me did you like the last Lynch?, I would say Yes. If added then her you recommend me?, the answer is? Neither of coña!. Mainly because I don't like the represalias.¿Y by what this contradiction? Do because some parts of Inland Empire me excited, because I am a fan of the director and I like how in this film parodies himself, because I respect his right to the waiver and? because got me free.Lynch has made what has left of his zany brains without taking into account that the Viewer - even started his world - a ration of three hours can be indigesta. The film has no rhyme or reason, aim brilliant stories are always in the air and if salts of the room mulling over this mental homage to Onan you've seen you end up ten minutes in a psychiatric.Next to Inland Empire, Mulholland Drive and head Borradora have a storyline so affordable as of Yo soy Bea. But the moments of the episodes of Rabbits, the action of Grace Zabriskie, the music, the sequence in which the chinita tells the story of his friend who has a monkey for pets and a homeless yells: Why us accounts that shit?, are great. It could follow a few lines because 180 minutes give much.In overall, between the initial thrill some of sopor halfway through the footage, turns that you know that you will not lead to nowhere and other? the only conclusion is that Lynch has been a little bit assembling nightmares, as in dreams, lacking any consistency. Is this film a bullshit? I do not know, is subjective? is a painting by Miró bullshit that would make your five-year-old nephew? Yourself.</body>
