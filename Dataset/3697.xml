	<summary>Entretendia but finally somewhat disappointing film of horror / fantasy.</summary>
	<body>Entertaining horror film more or less fantastic that however it remains clearly lower than it could have been.And it is not just by convincing at all, despite the fact that passes the time and the interest not lapses over the footage. A rather long footage for what counts, the truth.The best of the film, apart from its effective special effects is that the written script has gained shape film a short of the famous Stephen King story, lengthening with effects and situations a narrative that apparently didn't to tando.And do them it well until the last minutes, used the tension and supposed terror, with elements that appear slowly, getting a few impacts that are expressing as it progresses the argument. It is not that they are to throw rockets, but yes they entertain and do not you go the movie. But I think situations become at the end in excessive lengthening footage unnecessarily, until you reach a somewhat dull epilogue.For its part, the protagonist, an omnipresent John Cusack, does with his accustomed profesioanalidad, although sometimes it happens in their terror and panic before what happens. Let's say that more or less at the beginning, when cut with the window of the room, be it scares too much, when it was not yet to both, I think. But, of course, I say that it was sentadito comfortably in the armchair, in his case. And in addition, is not his fault, but the writer.Broadly is a film that gives the adopted and gets to the good, but limited, and may have reached the remarkable with a little more than imagination. But it is not bad.</body>
