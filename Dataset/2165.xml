	<body>The third film by Sofia Coppola is a film very irregular, alternating scenes of one great movie with others that are really painful, in part due to the music. In this film the music is something that cannot be avoided because it draws attention to the use made of it at certain times, a modern music in a film set in the 18th century is a risky bet, and at times the result is good, but the rest of the film, the music thumping andcommonly, said "not paste or glue".It is clear that Sofia is a Director brave and special, as he was already evident in Lost In Translation and the Virgin suicides, not intended to stay in the conventional forms of cinema, but that he likes to experiment, and print their own style in his films, something that makes you earn points as a filmmaker, although it sometimes risk both the result leaves much to be desired. Great moments as the dinner of the Kings with the noise of the crowd of Fund are overshadowed by the rest of the film, which at the end leaves the feeling that it could have been much better, although it is right to reflect the type of life of pre-revolutionary French monarchy, with its luxury and ostentation while people are dying of hunger. The viewer understands and it identifies with the situation of the young Queen, I did not know another kind of life and perhaps time was not aware that there was an entire people that did not have what to eat, something that has some parallels with the current situation in the world, where the first world people live full of luxuries and comforts while millions of people are dying of hunger unless we do nothing to remedy it outside the Palace.</body>
