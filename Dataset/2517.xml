	<body>Dodgeball ("ball game" on Argentina and only dvd) has each and every condiment of the current American Comedy: entertaining and light, endearing characters and too many stereotyped? and to generally poorly delineated - couples and ultimately actions: redondita and vacuous. Here is also the eternal fight between good and evil in a parody, which ultimately fails to conform to no one.An almost non-existent script which is pure pretext for cataract of jokes and funny situations (only of a times) but the brief cameo of Hank Azaria, William Shatner, David Hasselhoff and Chuck Norris troop only more grace. Everything else is a right direction of Thurber because it becomes almost invisible, the surprise with the hard Vince Vaughn in a role voorkeur in his career and a long, and sustained pace all together sounds like too little by the expectation and the cast.But the big problem of Dodgeball is the noticeable hiccup of Ben Stiller, in charge of the first great overacting of his career, out of tune, which stand out as one of the best comedians of the time. A rather boring character machietta and pulling heavy. Dodgeball is recommended on dvd for a Sunday afternoon. Just to see fast today and forget tomorrow.</body>
