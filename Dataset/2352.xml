	<body>He was not eager to see the new proposal by Eli Roth, but inertia took me to see it. My previous feelings were confirmed. The film is bad, pretty bad. On the basis of a scheme similar to the previous one, instead of being directed by three guys, now are females that know what is being tortured and afraid. By means of a beautiful woman, the girls accept going to a spa in Slovakia, and of course, we know what will happen. The innovation of this sequel is that Roth shows us the side two torturers, two American rich to see for the first time in the ranks of the elite hunting.A from there, topics and more topics involved in a script, if you can call, do not understand how they did not rewrite, since it leaves much to be desired.The best: some blows black comedy, which takes place at the end of the film and who is starring these little devils in "Hostel" calling gum tourists.It is curious as to the protagonist being treated with excessive respect, not be get to see either in bikini (and that is a Spa), and instead show us many other things. There are some cameos and references in "Hostel 2" that deserve mention, such as the Elisabeth Bathory on. As for the actors, none that particularly stands out.The atmosphere and the beauty of the locations are the most striking aspect of this torture called "Hostel 2", which hopefully does not have continued.</body>
