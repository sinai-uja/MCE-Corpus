However, the last film for Cuarón not interested so much how has arrived at the revelation, but the parallel and alternative path that emerges in front of him. Which undertakes last pregnant women toward the hope this Odyssey narrated without flashes, between overwhelming and scary, uncertain pace that almost impossible, the protagonists move groping for the chaos and rubble, by frames that seem more realistic than usual in the genre, and therefore closer; without literature. Thus the Chronicle is transformed into science fiction, and this in turn becomes horror film. Children of men is a parable for the future without too much makeup, who dislocated a couple of decades the diseases of our days, now already terminals. The date is in fact almost contextual, circumstantial a necessary toll of the setting. Probably what I write this, we have already reached the film, or she has caught us.But as this is a story of hope, Clive Owen struggles, in the midst of the widespread blackout to light of dreams and illusions to an infertile world. So in the meantime cry and noise, don't ever hear presuroso crying of a newborn in search of love.</body>
