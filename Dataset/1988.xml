	<summary>A tape Spanish more, with a curious air that sweetens but fails to sink, except those who have lived with a similar ailment.</summary>
	<body>This morning, while took me my coffee and my 2 donuts of rigour, and quarreled with a ceaseless headache (migraine perhaps) which leads accompany me during a good part of the day (perhaps victim of the hangover of illusion of the team of my loves), I was surprised myself seeing again, "7 vírgenes" emitted at that time on Canal +This tape I already talked at the time, but has been the presence of Juanjo crossbow which has given me walk to see this, another film, where the record of the same change is evident, and that no mistake, to crossbow we have seen him as "el bola" (the character made him famous) in all the films in which has participated after the tape of Achero Mañas. Me calls powerfully the attention than film Spanish without tits girls, is not Spanish film and that, after looong uncover years, yet still shows a libérrimo sinus on any tape "made in spain" self-respecting.I did not like anything the band sound, repetitive, heavy, insistent and boring and is reminded me in some way to those boxes of music or little insistent music that we see in some video games and that little, to say nothing, has to do with the development of the story.A good staff accompanied by many unknown faces, only dressed with Alex or television?Doherty and the splendid Manuel Alexandre, complete the distribution of the tape.With external shot in the center of Madrid and places that I frequent quite often, for example, the Summit of the car scene is shot a few meters from the House of my in-laws.A small detail has anyone seen the CGI we have cast? Too bad it note so that it is a mere special effect, since it had seemed rather surprising to me.While the tape found me entertaining and quite funny; for what to translate certain likelihood a disease that I have suffered for a quarter of my life (Yes, I've been epileptic), sometimes they are going the pot to the happy issue of the protagonist, because while it is true that one feels a tremendous sense of fear and ridiculous after a crisis if it has done something inadequateleaving the disease you expire is a mistake, something that I learned when with 11 years I was diagnosed with the disease is namely to control and to never leave that outside it that guide my life now for 2 years that I finished my treatment, I still think the epilepsy as a fellow traveller, somewhat heavy, but it must never ruin your life.Forgive me for a few moments he has spoken of something that had to be dealt with and who know perfectly well that nobody cares a damn, but as always, and for which I read regularly is a good way to cure my neuro and frighten my demons.A tape Spanish more, with a curious air that sweetens but fails to sink, except those who have lived with a similar ailment.</body>
