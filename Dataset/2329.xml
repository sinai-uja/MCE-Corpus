	<body>Does Sam Mendes seems an interesting and with a style director in storytelling quite attractive, which pulled out to perfection in?Do American Beauty?, and who then improved even more with?Road to perdition?. Was his next job?Do do Jarhead?, film in the first Gulf war, where American soldiers are waiting orders in the desert of Saudi Arabia. maybe the only thing attractive in my opinion of?Jarhead? they are the actors, and the signing of Mendes, which its essence, so present in his two other works already mentioned, seems to have vanished in this last, though it appears in some master sequences (that you can count on the fingers of one hand, by the way). Jake Gyllenhaal and Jamie Foxx are splendid, brutal, monsters. Worst of all is that the film becomes too long, and as not account anything, as that is a kind of deflated balloon that fails to petar because two people do not want (Gyllenhaal and Foxx).In short: an interesting proposal, but disappointing and somewhat deflated, it stays in something correctito, but forgettable. And it is that you expected me much more of Mendes, after those two PE-LI - CU-LO-NES which were?American Beauty? and?Road to perdition?.</body>
