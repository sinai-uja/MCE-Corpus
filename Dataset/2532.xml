	<body>The narrative is an art of synthesis. Narrate is to compose a whole whose parts are expressed attributes or nuances that have to be functional to conceptual or dramatic effects at all. In his new film, David Fincher proposes a thorough and obsessive chronicle relates that on the police world of crime and to the influence of the sensationalist media. "Such a chronic is structured as a puzzle in which its various elements (police, criminals, suspected criminals and press) interact in a game of compulsive feedback: see how police seek and/or try to ignore the relevance of the criminal matter so much as the criminal police is looking for or hides the device media and police for weeks or even years.""Zodiac" is not the narration of a mystery, but a process that unfolds in all the antagonistic pillars of the function, an obsessive process whose raison d ' être we can glimpse the implied a revitalized gender laws - that non-reformulated, very common mistake - in the hands of Fincher, and becomes a smart product of revisitación to a paradigmatic areas. Importantly, the purpose of the speech is not knowing the identity of the criminal, but the progression towards a certain psychological state, which concretizes itself in the final climax of the story through the character known as Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal). The narrative strength is based on the superb construction of characters. We are talking about psychological film, and in that area the profiles human are essential, various psychological patterns expressed by each of the protagonists, different ways of dealing with the conflict, are a very decent representation in the characterization and development of them. The conflict, in this case, isn't limited to the mysterious identity of the offender, a criminal who seems to adopt multiple identities, depending on the findings, recesses or curves that encouraged further in the labyrinth of the suspicions and the slopes. The conflict also materializes in a "why", and a search for meaning to hunting and capture by the representatives of the law and order. Why search for to "Zodiac"?. Is it a real entity or a product of the press and the playful intelligence of an anonymous citizen?. In this film, the relationships of cause and effect between crime and (alleged) criminal mask, as an effect of the proposed game. "Zodiac" is a killer that evaporates when closer seems to be resolution, and closest us is the more distant in memory over two decades. This ambiguous atmosphere as a fog of evanescent suspicions is the best definition of the spirit of the work.Also highlight the excellent work of mounting and visual rhythm, two essential tools to keep the attention of the viewer in a narrative that often becomes too dense and provide more data of the assimilated, but all this is according to go creating the aforementioned psychological state of the protagonists, is not a mere whim of the writer.Brushing the perfection as film representation of a chronology of events resulting in a dramatic story, Zodiac fails a fundamental aspect. It ends not coagulate its leitmotiv in its intention to give the Viewer. In other words; You cannot find a way of articulating the whole through which express a meaning giving more significant force to the story. Despite all its virtues, or Zodiac leaves an aftertaste to emptiness, that has not finished off the ground if we attend to all its goals and suggestive content. That is why, in the end what we have left is the impression that we have seen a conventional police thriller, which was intended to be much more than it is, that at times he notices too the rigidity of its schematic and to not always achieve adequately convey the idea that the Chronicle progresses according to a specific dramatic content. Simple: is a strong but superficial narration ultimately.</body>
