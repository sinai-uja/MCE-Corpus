	<body>Slow, boring, snooty. How can shoot a film on "thieves" with so much music for Orchestra and only a Chase (and quite sad indeed)?. Too many slow cameras, sobran close-up and take more action and more script. A predictable script somewhat 単o単o, with characters coming out of the imagination of the author and not the street. I went with all the hopes of a good Spanish movie and went home denying once again the Spanish film, bored and above gives them of "sophisticated".They did not impress in slow images, not impress the acting work or the nor of her, not impress the millions of stage-managed scenes that submitted to us by its director, and especially not impressed the love story, already somewhat taken with tweezers.I wonder what will be thinking the producers who opt for this kind of movies. Would have gone to see her?. When I left the cinema, I thought I was the only one dissatisfied. It is that "do not understand film", of course. Nor understood little more than 50 persons who "swarmed" room. Long, boring faces and more than one "go rollazo", and "go NAP I missed". That said, desesperanzadora, slow, boring and snooty. It is that "you do not know film Victor". It must be that.</body>
