	<summary>After seeing the film you won't want to learn more about Da Vinci nor of his works</summary>
	<body>There is no give much back to the plot: Robert Langdom is a scholar of the old symbolism and is entangled in the murder of the teacher of the Priory by Opus Dei, behind hide many intrigues on the offspring of Jesus and the dark intentions of the Iglesia.La film fails to arouse the interest of the viewer or much less aspires to become a "taquillazo" and is that pace becoming boring at times and when it loses accelerates gives you time to process and understand what it is trying to show. He simply drowned in expectations and in famita of the "Da Vinci Code".Robert Langdom "Hanks" starts the film with an audiciencia presenting religious symbols to demonstrate that many things are not what they seem to be asking what this symbol? and when you try to think no time because less than half a second to the answers already are listed. And Sophie remains Amelie a simple spectator. To escape the plane SILAS not protest-no one remembers lost friends. At least his grandfather was not his grandfather.After seeing the movie, you won't want to learn more about Da Vinci nor of his works.</body>
