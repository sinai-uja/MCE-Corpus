	<summary>Impeccable argument to have you glued to the screen for an hour and a half</summary>
	<body>The argument of 16 streets is impeccable for have you glued to the screen for an hour and a half. A detective should lead to an offender to testify to the Court which is sixteen streets of distance. On the way they are shot and discover that the boy will uncover a plot of police corruption and his own teammates want to kill it before you arrive. The short distance enlarges every minute the police cut them the way to grow the tension.Bruce Willis is the honest policeman who fights against yours in a fit of honesty that cannot contain, role that usually makes. It is also drunk in hours of service and has gut, these defects that disfigure him for the first time, and hopefully that for last.The question became the filmmakers was both an offender risk worth it? Although the story is a zacchia flight urban, the item that beats is the better the life of the boy. Willis says very clear that everything in life changes, but people don't change. He wants to show him Yes. Anthony Mann shot almost all of his westerns to give reason to the boy. None is missing a capable of reformed gunman.In my opinion that thematic question was not the most timely. The question that I had done to the detective would have been: do Era that the time change? For the boy Yes, but it is less clear to the detective.</body>
