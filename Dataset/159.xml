	<summary>Is human dissatisfaction which seems to grow and need more drugs, sex and anything that produces recordables emotions</summary>
	<body>There I read on another blog a post about this movie which read simply: "Trash". While I do not think not even close to Hostel (2005) to be the best movie of Quentin Tarantino, I not be a waste.Hostel is on the search for the man by the extreme sensations, trafficking of human dissatisfaction which every day seems to grow and need more drugs, more sex and more anything that produces recordables emotions, thus be perverse experiences, as it is the case of this film. I think that I will not ruin the film nobody, because it is clear from the preview, writing that the film is about torture. Torture as pleasure.It says that it is based on real facts, I can not believe it. I do not recommend this film very sensitive people. If you are interested in the dark film, extravagant and intelligent Tarantino you should see it, but if you lose you nor do you have to cut the veins. You don't Kill Bill, Pulp Fiction isn't, not stars Uma Thurman, but as any other work of the author, it has the same amount of blood than these.However, noteworthy name in capitals of Tarantino attributed to this film is not as true, he was only one of the Executive producers and certainly gives the Insert marketero. But the real culprit, I say copyright, is a subject called Eli Roth, who directs and writes the script. This same Lord Announces Hostel 2, same theme. Currently in production. My humble opinion is that it does not deserve a second part. Eli Roth kept a blog during the production of hostel, if you want to read it click here.</body>
