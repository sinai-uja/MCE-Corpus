	<body>Vehicle for total and absolute showcasing of Jack Black as Nacho, the wrestler, while the movie continues to be a sum of gags (some with much grace, others with none), the film ends so spontaneous and you walk towards the exit of the room with another question in the head that the tape does not resolve, which is not that he intends.Jack Black incredible, squeezing out absolutely his humorous vein, his gestures, and especially his sense of humor, as is the first who laughs at himself, so fat he incorporated in these Mayan and wearing "triporra", with regard to their co-stars, perhaps makes it a tad of shadow (or him eclipse with its singular beauty), the Mexican actress Ana de la Reguera, well worth the price of admission see those eyes Jet color that appears on screen (and is, I admit it, I can eels).He did not want to finish without talking about Hector Jimenez, who plays the role of skeleton, and that with only 2 gestures and many (too many) screams, gets in the Pocket to the audience, this type ahead muuucha comedy show us.Indeed, the soundtrack runs on behalf of Danny Elfman, so we must walk "watchful ear". In short, funny, full of gags, those of scraping 5 tape.</body>
