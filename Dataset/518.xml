	<summary>Get together two totally antagonistic concepts: the romantic comédia and superhero movies in a single concept. A good proposal for all those we will see these movies "husband Consort" as pig for slaughter.</summary>
	<body>Ivan Reitman manages to unite two totally antagonistic concepts (the romantic comédia and superhero movies) in a single concept, a tape of entertainment for all ages, just so you can understand much Puritan touch on the tape (sex with clothes?), the tape begins on an exceptional basis, a pity his change of pace in the last half-hour, which becomes a tad "unbearable".Interpretive level highlights a Uma Thurman in State of grace, a kind of "Supergirl" which in his Alter-ego resembles a female version of Clark Kent, and since her role in Tarantino's "Kill Bill", is one of the muses of 90% of the male population; While Luke Wilson, is not at the height, not even achieved copar low expectations you can have to see him on screen, Anna Faris, its online, as in the "Scary Movie's" but slightly more restrained.Few special effects (incréible for a film of this magnitude), are quite achieved, and the music accompanies beautifully every minute of footage, in short, a good proposal for all those we will see these movies "husband Consort" as pig for slaughter.</body>
