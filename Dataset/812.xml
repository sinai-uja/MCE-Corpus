	<body>Who compare infiltrators with good guys should see her again. The departed is the film most overrated of the year. With good performances Yes, but without atmospheres or commitment.The perfect Edition of Scorsese, Thelma Schoonmaker, right hand makes it worth every scene alone, but the speed with which the scenes occur does not create the necessary environment for the engagement of the viewer with some of the characters. They are very short and full (but full) scenes often unnecessary dialogues.Nicholson returns to give us one of his runaway, hysterical and unsafe characters. Di Caprio is showing signs of his talent not so easy to sprout, Scorsese sees in him the successor of De Niro and gives much free rein to develop his character. Damon does not hold with his impeccable smile to convince to be a mafia compromised in Boston and police Whalberg always in pose, never hesitant. The characters are one-dimensional, impossible to give a full figure, positioning them in spaces that give them motivation and/or reasons for doing what they do. Their actions are because they are, without place to meditate the why.The rat walking along the balcony scene clearly shows the concept which has Scorsese on the public (do American perhaps?). All easy, served in tray, clear. A film with great actors (stars), understandable and it did not disappoint in terms of action shots (blood). A critical Oscar.La film has not been charitable with "Marty" lately and is time to offset the malostratos. If to this we add an impeccable casting and grossing soundtrack, we face one of the films with more nominations for the awards ceremony in February 2007.</body>
