	<body>When I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it was a typical comedieta style Santiago Segura with Santi Mill√°n and Fernando Tejero exaggerating too much his role as handicapped and and the truth is that after seeing her you you get a very nice surprise. What stands out above all of the film is its sensitivity towards people who have a disability of any kind, in fact the creator of the film's screenplay, Albert Espinosa is lame from it for a long time and is also the author of the wonderful 4th, floor which is a person who knows first-hand the problems faced by this kind of people to society. In the film, exquisite dialogues with a very clever humor are and also critical to all parts of society, both to persons dealing with disabled people as if they were idiots like to many people that always gets defensive when it is a mere comment on disability which has not the slightest importance. None of the three protagonists exaggerates in his interpretation, moreover, they are quite credible characters adopting. Situations that have to pass are very fun playing much with deficiencies in hearing, sight and a limp that mixed with such situations give a very surprising cocktail and at the same time produces you more than one smile. And I don't want to forget of exceptional leadership by Joaquin Oristrell who cares the script a lot and makes the film a rhythm and a quite pleasant interest towards the Viewer.</body>
