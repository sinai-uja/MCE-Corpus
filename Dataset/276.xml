	<body>Brian Singer is still trying to show their inner scholar, but the truth is that, the genius of the lamp has not just wake up after "Usual suspects". Cataloging and his X-men and its Superman as quite normal films.The man of steel, for many, symbolizes the hero par excellence, perhaps by their paradoxical humanity, proximity, buenhacer and because what is humans anela dream, such as fly, resolve the conflicts in the world, etc..Then Superman acquires megalomaniac dimensions and is when the genius Richard Donner comes into action after its "The Omen" and with a filmography quite modern and outstanding; Donner would create their version of hero that since my opinion has not yet been beaten.Comparisons are odious, but Singer has attempted to resurrect two personalities such as Brando and Reeve which is somewhat morbid, giving green light to enable one to dispatch to taste and to realize that attempts to make lasting works are far to simple blockbuster dunces.Observe for example in the vision of Singer trend of aberration of the colors in the film or that new suit so fluffy style "gum boomer" stripping that proximity or nearness that Reeve had mortals; and being a little more fussy and as something personal, were needed such modern refinements in styling and costume of the man of steel?The most worrying thing is a script as progresses, one can notice the decline of printed clear interest, to the point of seeing inconsistent things little you worthy of the Superman saga. And luckily, that despite everything, the film remains supported a Brandon Routh and Kevin Spacey with some pretty awesome homonimos faces and to some extent giving very well the size and new airs or nuances to the series; except the henchmen of Lex, which I think that they were not a good choice as well as the discrete soundtrack, which despite of having as a legacy of Williams, without penalty and without glory.The rest of details such as special effects, little worthy today, taking into account that in Hollywood is the only thing that lately do and of course the good dirección-dominio of the House of Singer, give me to think that sometimes it is better to leave to the superheroes where have been always (on paper) and be more conscientious and consistent with the responsibility associated with resurrect a myth that perhapsbest not be awakened.
