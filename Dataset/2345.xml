	<body>Something bad happens to a comedy when the two songs with greater importance in its plot are bars initials of Live and Let Die by Paul and Linda McCartney and 9 of Damien Rice, which is not exactly the joy of the orchard.Gives too lazy comment on a movie like this, so I did not expend many words. Shrek the third is a unnecessary film, by the mere fact of making money; the formula is exhausted, the worn-out characters, the weary writers. There is no life in the film, is an inert product for 90 minutes. Everything that happens is predictable and without grace, even for children who are targeted. Technically it is more of the same, there is no innovation, it saves even in that aspect. It has nor the irreverence (albeit with many nuances) from the first, or spoof the second tone. Finally a horror, that does not serve or for children to spend a good time (proven) film. And the worst is that they have already given the green light to the fourth and fifth part.In summary, huid of the plague.</body>
