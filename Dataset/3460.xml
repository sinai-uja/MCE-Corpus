	<body>Few teenage horror films are capable of a study out that crucial step for life topics. Perhaps one of the most outstanding was the CARRIE of BRIAN DE PALMA. Not the subgenre of Lycanthropy offered too many joys, howls or an American Werewolf in London are the light within shadows that offer this type of films.GINGER SNAPS was a genuine surprise in 2000 bringing a freshness to the genre that in those moments after successes of the type series SCREAM lived his lowest moments.While the proposal seems to be the typical teen horror film, is distancing itself from the beginning offering a strange relationship between the two sisters performed protagonists they repeated their roles brilliantly by EMILY PERKINS and KATHERINE ISABELLE is two sequels that although minor remained interesting.The strong part is the transformation of GINGER going from a dark teenager to attract all the boys, unleashing an appetite by blood and sex in her narrated by rookie John FAWCETT I disappoint in his second film THE DARK with the bowels.His stunning soundtrack is another aspect to be highlighted, special effects its great handicap especially at the end where the transformation comes to an end with something mediocre results.However this is not without prejudice to taste one of the best films on Lycanthropy and adolescents carried out with a force long horror film not provided.</body>
