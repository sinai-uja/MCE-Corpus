	<body>I agree with a friend that put me on notice when he knew my intention to see this film. He came to say that the poster was sweet as a lenguetazo to a jar of jam. He has a habit that continues to strictly: be carried away by the most basic impression, the primary. In this case, not liked at all the advertising Assembly or not (I was, in part, with him) the cover. Then I warned with a more effective strength: you'll see a ñoña film. That adjective disarmed me, but I desatendí my misgivings and me colé in viewing of the subject. It would have been better heed of friendship. The friends are a treasure, as a song it says. This, a couple of them.Miss Potter is a sobrevitaminado of sugar candy: an unbearable exercise of simpering emotional ombliguismo. Da that are just there to avoid the debacle two recent fuste actors such as Ewan McGregor and Renée Zellweger. The precipitate film is inevitable because the pastelón is so overwhelmed magic, rabbits and noble sentiments which cloying with two or three minutes of exposure. The such Beatrix Potter, Rowling in early 20th century, had to be an entreñable Lady, very literary foundations, but the film overwhelms, disturbs, produces the opposite of what you search, we install in some comfortable position of distance. Not just never one to enter at all while the actors (the three main, McGregor, Zellweger and Emily Watson) es´tén frankly well.So nice and well done everything to scale.</body>
