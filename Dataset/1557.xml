	<body>This is a tape that had to have gone to see in press pass, just have been my "baptism of fire" in the film premieres, however, a family problem that not worth noting, prevented me from seeing her at the time, and taking advantage of already on DVD today now, I've taken a ratillo to do so.The film that brings us is a prodigy of animation, well looked in some way to the already legendary "Antz" (Antz), recalls more than anything by the design of the characters; these ants that more resemble crabs than to those summer animals that eat us the omelette when we picnic snack.One of the things more complicated to do in animation (say it experts not me), is water, in this movie the feeling of the liquid element is very successful, and in the scenes where this is leading, the sense of reality is amazing.Lately I am fairly disillusioned with the dubbing, which has imposed fashion that "good turn" are those who put the voices to the characters, not like in the USA, where, for example, Nicolas Cage, Julia Roberts, or Meryl Streep, were responsible for putting voices in this film; Spain have been Carmen Maura and Anabel Alonso (which already has experience with the "Buscando a Nemo" Dory) charge to voice 2 of the protagonists, and I break a lance for the 2, since they do it really well, and it is not difficult to forget that they appear on screen.There are 2 things that I liked the film, and it is that, although the idea of the plot is promising, the characters and the story are too seen, see, I mean, the story is good, and helps children to be tolerant with others and with the environment, that given the current situation, need, but, the characters are too linear, bad very bad, very good good. Is true that we cannot ask a Shakespearean drama, a child tape but.In short, that I get more we: A tape of quite achieved animation that will bring a dose of tolerance to the kids of the thing, with a story that could have given more if, but that entertains.</body>
