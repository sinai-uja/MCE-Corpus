	<summary>The farewell of the sisters reaches the bottom of the glass as he says goodbye to a convict to death?</summary>
	<body>The film begins with the arrest of Salvador Puig. Shoot in a struggle against a police and kills him; he receives more than seven shots, one of them in the face. His lawyer visits him in jail and heard the story of his life. The actually tells us, the spectators. His fight against the Franco regime, the band of anarchists who use France as a refuge, the way in which are raising the level of violence, everything is narrated with inaccurate images who want to seem taken from a newsletter of the time. Only two details seem improved, rather than telling the story to a lawyer, who should know, could have been told something paleto jailer who plays Sbaraglia. Instead of the present because it does not have in past?After this tour by the rebellious Catalonia in the 1970s, the film comes to a disproportionately dramatic intensity to tell us the last months of life of the convicted person. The murder of Carrero Blanco, knows, means yours. The fight against time; the dictator and the invisible military junta as a black hand; the family, the father, the jailer. The farewell of the sisters reaches the bottom of the glass as he says goodbye to a convict? The director didn't need the volume up to get impact so strongly, the mere image of the facts is desquiciante. The film is filled with sense in documents like this (or as "United 93"), when broken down minute by minute the way that builds an historical fact, one of those moments that change our way of seeing things.</body>
