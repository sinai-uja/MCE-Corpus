	<summary>"Free" in "the Prince and the pauper" adaptation, and an argument that would blush to any screenwriter apprentice.</summary>
	<body>Second part of this monstrosity called "Garfield" and what do I then commenting on the movie? Because having at home to a fan of the Orange Cat, takes you to the head film, jokes without regard to the purest style "Poop, ass, fart, pis" that are going to love to the kids of the House (the room was littered with munchkins), humor with one blow of spotted people, and stupid jokes; It is true you can not ask pears to the elm, before a tape of this magnitude, especially designed for children, is what there is, or is taken or is left.A couple of nonsense have started me a slight (very slight) smile, the predictable rest, "free" in "the Prince and the pauper" adaptation, and an argument that would blush to any screenwriter apprentice (the script lacks any sense), if it is true that the recreation of Garfield and Prince ("sister") is excellent (even in the shadows and reflections), the film is painful, except that have an orange at home cat fan, as it is my case, or some eager child film munchkins!DO NOT GO! (you will).</body>
