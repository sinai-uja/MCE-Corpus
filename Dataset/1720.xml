	<summary>Unconditional love until death. A story of impossible love that acongoja from the beginning until the end, unforgettable. A lesson in excellent film.</summary>
	<body>Splendid film by Hiroshi Inagaki, of the "samurai", full of virtues, both films, as human.It is funny and touching at the same time, making the viewer experience the adventures of the protagonist as our own, despite his rudeness and ignorance.Some endearing characters in their overflowing humanity, which must live on a daily basis in peace, being trustworthy and honest, over the years (we are at the beginning of the 19th century).Excellent performances, where stands out, once again, the great Toshiro Mifune, a giant of the dramatic composition, perfect in its intensity and its containment.Moments like the endurance race, or when you touch the drum of Gion, they are wonderful, as well as the beautiful photography and impeccable and beautiful costumes.A story of impossible love that acongoja from the beginning until the end, unforgettable. A lesson in excellent film.This film won the Golden Lion at the Venice Festival in 1958.</body>
