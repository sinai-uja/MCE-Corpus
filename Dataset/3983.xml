	<summary>There is nothing out of this world, but at least it is more entertaining than the rest of fantastic films and adventures starring children repellents.</summary>
	<body>Directed by Jon Tuntertaub and starring Nicolas Cage, John Voight, Ed Harris, Harvey Keitel, Diane Kruger, Helen Mirren, Bruce Greenwood and Justin Bartha, a few weeks ago came to our charts search 2: secret diary, film that Disney returned to bring us the adventures of buscatesoros Ben Gates.En this time, Gates will be involved in an incredible adventure that has arisen following the discovery of one of the lost pages from the diary of John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of Abraham Lincoln; According to that page, the great-grandfather of Ben would be a martyr for the American cause to be identified as one of the conspirators of the assassination, which is why Ben Gates will try to prove the innocence of his ancestor in an adventure that will take you to travel the world to find one of the most famous lost cities of the pre-Columbian civilization.In short, more of the same, with all that this entails.As it happened with his first delivery, search 2: secret diary continues playing him to a server as an Indiana Jones of lower levels, in line with the Mummy saga although without its inherent Egyptian charm, both by the abysmal gap between to Harrison Ford of Nicolas 'have not quiff' Cage, as by the own treatment of the story. And it is trying to perform a consistent script at the same time varied from the history of a nation as young as United States, seems it one tired chimeric, not to say bizarre task.In spite of this, the search 2: secret diary is quite entertaining if you have to see her without too many expectations and long passes both its patriotic exaltation and his blatantly family air, in which the Gates family aunará the entire forces leaving aside their personal differences to embark on an adventure to a server pointed you to the mythical Goonies, although neither could tell very well why.Two minutes in Paris, five in London and more than an hour and a half in United States touring from the monument to Abraham Lincoln to the library of Congress, through the oval office in one of the saddest scenes of the film, Ben Cage will deshilvanando different puzzles that will lead you to a substitute for Atlantis through sequences mix of action, comedy (at least, I guess that was the intention of the writers) and completely impossible situations, that manage to keep to a greater or lesser extent the expectation of the espectatdor, at least until its final half-hour, which is already completely tired.And it is nor Nicolas Cage seems an actor capable of sustaining itself a film of this type, nor interested in the ins and outs of the history of United States too much to the viewer with the exception of the own Americans, so the film is sometimes rather monotonous despite its fast pace. On the other hand, the wastage of the character played by Ed Harris is one of the greatest scourges search 2: secret diary, because its role but could disappear for the benefit of a more bearable footage, or grant him a greater presence, because the actor of New Jersey Eclipse to the rest of the cast with its single presence.Anyway, nothing out of this world, but nor is it insulting. What expected?</body>
