	<body>Do not I was disappointed because I knew that it was the film weaker Charlie Kaufman and Michel Gondry, so I expected the worst, and perhaps for this reason, no it has seemed so terribly bad, although it isn't at the height of Gondry and Kaufman.Cuando has finished the movie I tried to think that it is wrong in it, perhaps the script? I think that no, but nor is it the best of Charlie Kaufman, but it could have made a more interesting film.Fails the interpretation of actors, perhaps why the characters not excited to the Viewer, gives what just happens them, and therefore believe that these characters are not well built, are very superficial and even cold.Patricia Arquette I don't like, I never liked, I do not think it is good actress, although he wears some pretty natural nude in this film. Tim Robbins acts well from time to time, but this has not been one of those times. And Rhys Ifans does not wrong at all.It has some moments that I liked and when he sees mice eating with cutlery, I liked the music of that time. But little more should be noted, is a story of Gondry courage to dare to take her to the cinema and original.</body>
