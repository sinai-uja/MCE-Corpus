	<body>I don't know if the Click writers have read the book of "Fish", but honestly I prefer the movie to the infamous prose of the book to hear the same speech. "Fish" is a vain attempt to explain with four axioms as it creates a good atmosphere among people. The two first, "must be present" and "one chooses his State of mind," are those illustrating the film.Not be present is called in the film "autopilot". The protagonist, uses his remote control to skip the scenes of his life that you dislike, so not lives them. We, the public, turn on auto-pilot half of our lives, and 100% of working time. Has someone received once in his life a sincere smile of a seller, a window or a waiter?The premise of the film is that Adam Sandler Gets a remote control that allows you to rewind, pause, and accelerate your life at will. So the man passes pipe with the buttons making your holy will until the writers Ascend you to the chepa and decide to give him a good lesson. This second part, somewhat less fun but necessary for viewers leave the film made some more civilised guys, fusilada is the visit of the ghost of Christmas come of the "Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens, or if you like, of its film version, "That beautiful it is to live".</body>
