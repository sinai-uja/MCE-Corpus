	<summary>Do a movie fun by original situation, seeing to a? Grandpa? as Beatty jumping and dancing at full speed.</summary>
	<body>There are some films which for reasons unknown or little advertised, never come brand new in our country on dvd. One of many is Bulworth, the last film directed by Warren Beatty in 1998. It is a political satire that had its premiere in salas, payment channel? and it ended there. De_hecho I have a special affection for this movie because it was the first I saw in Madrid about 6 years ago in the already closed cinemas Luna.Y've never again to hear from her, except via the internet, of course, wonderful source of information and other things that do not reach market;) the Senator Jay Bulworth is low hours. When he decided to order his own assassination (could well be a defense of euthanasia: P) starts to discover how wonderful it is to live life without ties, having fun and saying the truth: lives jumping the entire agenda of speeches and campaign events, has fun with rap and Halle Berry and telling the truth after the manner of Michael Moore, ClooneyPenn and all that speech, with this film, is showing that it is not new but if repetitive and hypocritical.Does Warren Beatty met for this film talent such as Storaro in photography, Morricone music (which combines with good rap songs) and with actors such as Paul Sorvino, the eternal secondary Oliver Platt, the beautiful Halle Berry, Don Cheadle? It is a film fun by the original situation, the sight of a "Grandpa" as Beatty jumping and dancing at full speed and by the good Office of the director, who manages to do a critique of the policy in his country, although always in the same direction.A very interesting film and that gives a turn of the screw more political satire.</body>
