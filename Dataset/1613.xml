	<body>"Big Fish" reminds me much to my father, who was a great stories counter, is why, when I finished to see I was touched just like the first time I saw her, filling me with the eyes of tears at the end of the same. The film sometimes and in some way resembles the magic that conveyed us Burton in "Edward Scissorhands" actually in the trailer for the same can listen to its main theme. It means the return of Tim Burton to the fantasy world which had relegated in his lackluster "Planet of the apes". It is an ode to freedom and imagination in which the free and creative spirit is seen as an authentic vital privilege steeped in optimism. The spectator attends a real image of two-hour fairy tale with pleasure and fun. In this singular tragicomedy, Burton knows combine rightly dramatic moments with other filled with romantic, magical and surreal situations with other fondly human who manage you identify fully with what appears on the screen. Manages to convey the lack of understanding that can be between two beings however appreciating, as well as the need for that imagination permeated our lives. Added to what is the realization of a Tim Burton able to create authentic Visual delusions, as it has done previously. Without diminishing the final result. Now that you have on DVD!Run out and buy it! (not ye shall go forth disappointed)</body>
