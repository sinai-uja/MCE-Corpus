	<body>In the world of amateur short film many kids without a budget but with a terrible desire to experience tend to entertaining products.ZIRCONIUM 77, FLUFF films or bad attitude among many others engaged in terrorizing the staff with many ideas and a desire to have fun.BLOGS as my dear terror and nothing else they do give small recognition they deserve which I gladly I said.I just saw a small wonder of friends of VINCENT films that in the case of the SLASHER of the whole life they give an attractive approach after the good use of space and a good staging.Great soundtrack, a frenetic montage for an entertainment shot with young people full of energy shamelessness.Obviously I will not criticize his lack of technical effects because photography or make-up are non-existent, but let us not forget that it's productions of zero budget with amateur people who just try to have fun.Anyway I think that they should improve the sound that many sentences are left out making it difficult to follow the plot.Let us hope that VINCENT films continue to improve their performance because they promise. I will be to tell.</body>
