	<body>If you read in a film directed by UMBERTO LENZI in the first thing you think is in the titles of the Italian kamikaze famous for his films on 1980s cannibals in fierce Cannibal or eaten alive. Authentic film absurdities that however took advantage of the exploitation of the era to lionize him in the art of the most extreme GORE.Amazing in all aspects is this guiallo with all the characteristics of the genus exalted by people of the caliber of Mario bava and DARIO ARGENTO, blood GLUGs, well made deaths, intrigue conducted with wisdom of a script superbly structured seamless in its path.Strikes the right direction in all aspects of the director, this magnificent photography and soundtrack, very correct interpretations of protagonist Antonio Sabato a well known actor in the Italian horror with many works to their backs. The Abbey of terror or REACTOR attest to the interpretative quality of the artist.A Guiallo to rediscover, notably brought to term by a filmmaker with a pretty bad reputation who at that time knew how to serve a good meal of frenetic pace, but maybe have some ups and downs in its plot.</body>
