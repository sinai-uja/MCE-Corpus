	<summary>Very bad, thriller that starts well and ends painfully.</summary>
	<body>Bloody mania have lately in cinema, decorate the movie with best the more strident and heavy music, this film, that baby a thousand similar films, 3rd work in the direction of screenwriter David S. Goyer, is one of those films that covered in the adoslescente terror, mystery and with a small dose of drama, seems more a television telefilm that a "more or less serious" film.Add tape takes to boot, it tries to be transcendental without success, and that tries to even plagiarizing the grossing and later "Ghost" without coming to this, or the soles of shoes.Interpretive plot have Marcia Gay Hayden (the only known of a rather than unknown distribution), that every day is old and damaged, go, age do not go well for his already wrinkled face.The argument goes twisting until you reach the most supine stupidity, and one ends, the time and peak of footage, twisting in the armchair and waiting for the closing credits.And look that he could have seen any other film and I've opted for this, send eggs.</body>
