	<summary>Adventures for the whole family, children see it and the parents are fried</summary>
	<body>Fuck that fear, imagine that you open the door and you find that you're in interplanetary space mounted in your own House and a brother to estrangular√≠as. And with Tin Robbins's father.The film is about a family Restruct in which the father and the mother take turns to the offspring in regime "a week you and another me". A six-year-old son, another ten and a late teenager kid make up the trio of gruesome children that have to discover that the family is the most beautiful thing there is. Total, for reasons which are not the case, discovers the small a game called Zathura, which makes his house being transported into space as if it were a ship. Do adventures wait them? Can you return healthy and safe? Who knows.Buf, the idea is fine, but becomes very heavy and completely loses interest as it is advancing. It is intended as a story that has a small child, in which there is no coherence and anything goes. As fantasy, this is all very well, but as a movie you far in the argument and only look a succession of special effects without a clear link. The characters are excessively prototypical, with a divorced father who is on good terms with her ex and works until Saturday, a horrific child, another asesinable and a daughter to stamp her head against the bidet. And the very absurd and excessively moral end.In short, divertimento for the little ones. They are or for the elderly a bit heavy, with many moral burden and too many emotions without ton.</body>
