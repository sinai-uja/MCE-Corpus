	<summary>These tapes, as well as the romantic comedies or tapes of Terror are always cut by the same pattern, is that they seem to "materials" of the of Fernando León de Aranoa but plan "A Americanitos foot".</summary>
	<body>Curtis Hanson-"8 mile" opened a "new trend" in the film, "the films of rappers", tapes that tell us the ups and downs, adventures or misadventures of types are not "Sisters of charity" and trying to escape their misery they put in this rap where any bad, with his "hiphopper" cap and his wide pants boyarmed with a "pipe" you can setup a "massacre of the cagalse" and where trainees from "GTA S.Andreas" prevailing "ball" causing a strange law of the jungle where wins the "negrata" with the worst face of animal.Anyway, I believe above I've beaten my own record "quoted" words, let's the film, more, one starring "50 cent" in some parts makes face of circumstances, other side of bad and other face of penalty, the worst thing is that this guy (like Eminem in "8 mile") has the same expressiveness as a brick and where almost matter more selling the soundtrack of the film that the raise more or less at the box office.And is that the tapes, as well as the romantic comedies or tapes of Terror are always cut by the same pattern, is that they seem to "materials" of the of Fernando León de Aranoa but plan "A Americanitos foot".Anyway, that I have not discovered anything new and who has thought to see it, that it sticks to what there is (more, less, or trap or cardboard).</body>
