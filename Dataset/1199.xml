	<body>I assume that you have already heard some things about this movie, if it is very violent, little rigorous historically. anything. Best thing is to forget everything and the only thing that if I tell you is that not expect an epic story, but rather one minor argument. A tribe attacked and a subsequent Chase - hunting that he occupies most of the tape.I will not enter into the historical presentation of the civilization. I don't have enough knowledge, while the director already tells us that it develops in the decline of the maya civilization, and therefore, its undeniable virtues and legacies are not dealt with in the same. In addition, no longer an action movie, violent (there are excesses in some images of blood), but in the context in which it develops, is not a violence that extremezca. Impressed me more scenes of El Laberinto del Fauno than these. Furthermore, the pace is hectic. There are moments for some easy smile, especially in the beginning, and I also prefer the looks and caractetizaciones of the characters.Although somewhat exaggerated form, is not wrong that in adverse times where it is believed that everything can be solved by dialogue, let us remember that the man has always been Hunter and warrior, and there is sometimes no choice but that fight.</body>
