	<summary>A film that avoids the usual line Spanish film, but that makes it through a repetitive and lacking spark argument.</summary>
	<body>Disorder is one of those Spanish movies characterized by escape from the usual line of patriotic cinema, which has always tended to abuse the comedy and the permanent sexual tension. In this case, the psychological aspect of the characters and scenarios, giving the film a more characteristic of other latitudes, but also correct environment has worked.Isn't that the argument is very original nor is developed with particular brilliance, but a quite correct interpretation of its cast, especially of the usually desaprovechada Ingrid Rubio, and a good job of production, get the end result has been acceptable, although I particularly lacking a more lively pace and a tad more of complexity in the plotHe would have perhaps won integers with the introduction of some twist or surprise that made not as predictable as it turns out.Fernando CÃ¡mara directed in 1997 memories of the fallen angel, a movie that already indagaba this online but to which was added a touch supernatural and uncertainty that my opinion, made a most interesting production before the us. In any case, disorder deserves to spend awhile, but not in the film, where I do not think to return to project, but the Chair of House and with a gin-tonic and a package of pipes to pass the time.</body>
