	<summary>The worst movie I have seen since Pepito pools or Jenaro from 14.</summary>
	<body>Cut and confit for exclusive use of eager paranormal emotions and clueless adults youth, Moscow zero does not convince anyone. It is a perverse exercise of degradation of film as an art, a tacky show of aspirations because Val Kilmer, Vincet Gallo and some giving another divo already at closing to participate. It tells the story of an anthropologist lost in the hell of the Moscow underground.And hell was the theater, dear readers: pain in the Chair, the feeling that the time, such as precious jewel, is squeezed, and enormous desire to the 90 minutes are completed hastily or that the Planner has a rush of self-respect and, failing in its ethical principles, unplug the machine and out to the corridor and honestly return the euros to viewers. Then they will appreciate. And do not write more because of when in they want when write twenty lines instead of the usual it desparrame semantic that gives me so much pleasure and which I inevitably aboco my natural cinephiles. Much is this. It deserves little. Anything. Silence. He should not have written this review. It should not have me swallowed so embarrassing footage. Fact is. Regalado notice.</body>
