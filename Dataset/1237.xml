	<body>Firewall is not the last film by Richard Loncraine, but the last adventure of Harrison Ford. And it is what sells. And what if he sells. Someone like Ford has guaranteed a minimum of public who want to see him in full form and doing what they know to do to perfection: interpret.In this case it is a computer expert responsible for the security systems of a bank that is about to merge with another large company.The trouble begins when a bad maloso incarnated by a great Paul Bettany, examines the lives of him and his family to kidnap them and control them better and thus be able to take advantage of knowledge of Stanfield (Ford).The film is based on the kidnapping and blackmail to a main character who is willing to do it to protect his family. However, the patience of the protagonist reaches a limit and the same reason why becomes victim becomes his trump card to win. It has some resemblance with rescue, we. And that is when we see Harrison that we wanted and we were waiting for. Accompanies Virginia Madsen making wife; from between cups it is already requested. And with good reason. The script is also riddled with moderately clever situations and with a more refined but effective cruelty that take a few good actors with utmost credibility.Although the technical aspect of the film will probably be unlikely (Malaciencia can have a post), the message of the film is quite clear: the firewall without human control does not help. The technology can be used in thousands of ways and can help us to achieve thousands of things, but always end up in the hands of the humans. Unless is fulfilled the prophecy of Terminator.</body>
