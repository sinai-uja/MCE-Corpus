	<summary>Offal, terror and wax to equal parts</summary>
	<body>After insufferable first half an hour, House of wax begins to heat, never better said, and we start to "delight" with al gore most disgusting horror I've seen long ago. It is the beginning of the movie, with a few characters more flat than the brain scanner of Mariah Carey and an American spark laugh laughing your Juanito Navarro. House of wax begins to take shape after 40 minutes more or less when one of the dumb blonde of the group comes to track the bad smell in the forest. The start becomes grotesque and surreal when after out of a quagmire of blood which she herself could have come perfectly, the boys find a hand buried between the sangraza and the skins. Then makes appearance in the movie the third brother slaughterer with cheroki tuneao shit until the flag, a role that the minds of thinking bineuronal will soon identify as "the bad guy".Until that time the movie is rather laugh than terror. But it gets serious when appear in scene the two brothers of the ghost town, and the scenes are becoming increasingly more intense as al gore and a few details that I leave you descubráis.Fuck me mareé when one of them pronounced famously said "don't worry, we're going to get out," not you the Miss because that scene is really acojonante. As also acojonante is when burning the House of wax that by what I have understood in the shooting was wax of truth, something noted in screen.Anyway, that when sales of the film is appreciated and you don't know if re-submitted to your worst enemy or return to see her but without cover your face lol</body>
