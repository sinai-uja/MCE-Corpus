	<summary>Painful until exhaustion, this completely made for the child audience, and went again and again through the same "modus operandi" saw us at the cinema 80's when we were small.</summary>
	<body>Now comes this mediocre sequel to another film also mediocre, although I admit that the first delivery came to amuse and entertain, this 2nd delivery there by where take it, though, for my own disappointment, we will get a 3rd party, insofar as this tape has raised what cost in just 3 days of display, part "of guilt" has it that it was rated in the USA "for all ages"so parents with their tender shoots populated cinemas to see the adventures of "The fantastic four".The tape, painful until exhaustion, this completely made for children, and we went again and again through the same "modus operandi" saw us at the cinema 80's when we were small, and it is that of so predictable, bland and poorly conducted is the tape, one cannot stop thinking that you are kidding and that Marvel executives, they have assigned the rights more thinking about the fortunón of $$ that will lead from the sale of merchandise, that by which the tape whether or not a success (which if it has been).Few things can stand out as "good" or that is worth perhaps contemplate the excellent realization CGI of "Silver wake", since the rest, much argument, as scenes of action such as soundtrack, as proceedings are extremely bad, and, although I always qualify as a grateful stomach capable of viewing anything, in this case, it is not so, and I've pulled "bufando" and cursing during much of the footage.The argument, is predictable and badly facing, pointless and bland, action scenes soundtrack falls into the same chords as the first, but who cares its dubious quality?, actions nuanced, although they rub in some moments in humor of "blow and with one blow", almost always performed to ensure that "the nanos" with what they see on screen, in short, a tape debtor other MARVEL hits such as "The Punisher", "Daredevil", "Elektra".In short, the tape I would love if I had 6 years, pity it takes almost 25 more.</body>
