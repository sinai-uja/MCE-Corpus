	<body>While fast walking in heels, is film avoids falling into easy clich√©s. It is not a deep examination of conscience, but it is a valid reflection on the commitment that we make between life and career. It forces us to look in a mirror, or at least a reflection of some dark glasses very fashion.Meryl Streep in the role of ruthless head manages to be subtle. Without ceasing to be, literally, the bad movie. What makes the character of Miranda Prietsley is as real as several heads I've had in my life. It is rumored that the character is based on Anna Wintour with whom the author of the novel, Lauren Weisberger, worked at Vogue magazine. Seems that Weisberger I can get good advantage of the opportunity.A smart girl gets a job far below it with which it barely earn enough to pay the rent. But takes it work to make things right, and learn how things are going. It ends does not fit with corporate slavery. They constantly repeat that other girls would kill for the opportunity. The opportunity to travel to Paris. But that's only because these girls still do not know that a thing is "go to Paris and see Paris" and another thing is to travel to Paris for work.I am not a snob of the film, obviously. Even so, buy is the Scorsese Film, it would be as compare to Helen Fielding with Dostoevsky. If you opt for Bridget Jones Needless to say that it is not Russian literature. Even so I had more novels like that and more movies like this. Because a fun movie is not easy. Which I have seen recently [Prime (shared secrets), The Family Stone (the jewel of the family) and Failure to Launch] were jerks. In contrast with the devil I I enjoyed a lot. The difference is in the attention to detail, or in this case to the accessories.</body>
