	<summary>A correct approach, and above all, the return of Sarah Michelle Gellar to screens, make the back a movie, the less appealing. Although not wait anything out of this world.</summary>
	<body>Far were already those golden days of horror film that gave us unforgettable titles as the changeling, the Exorcist or infernal possession. After many years in which major studios produced even this genre, the supernatural Thriller has resurfaced recently with great strength, rare being the month that we do not have any film of terror in the charts. But as often happens, quantity does not mean quality, and most of the films that deal with these issues suffer from an enormous lack of originality, being their arguments of an irritating simplicity; except, obviously, for the Japanese, who sometimes are just the opposite and are difficult to understand because of its strange development. Asif Kapadia, which is the name of the director, is facing his second foray into the film, after his acclaimed directorial debut, the Warrior, which garnered a number of awards and was acclaimed by public and critics back in the year 2003. Return tells the story of a young businesswoman who starts having frightening visions of a murder that took place many years ago, and while it is not that it is something especially innovative, the truth is that the issue is well made, and superbly played by its protagonist, Sarah Michelle Gellar, whose return to the screens after embody the known Buffy Vampire Slayer for seven seasons is one of the main incentives offered to us by the production. It should be noted, as a curiosity, the project arose from the need of the writer, Adam Sussman, write something on this subject, induced by the impression received after a personal loss of a good friend.</body>
