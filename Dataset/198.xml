	<summary>Matador has been one of the surprises of the film season</summary>
	<body>The Matador was one of the surprises of the film last season to take a repeated theme and tell it from a new perspective with enough black humor, accept it is the best type of humor that exists.One of the biggest surprises is to see Pierce Brosnan playing the same type of roles has been doing some time ago but from a totally new perspective and is one of the best performances of his career. In the film Brosnan plays a Hitman that lies in the middle of an emotional crisis, accustomed to being alone and not having a home to Julian Noble, the weight of years falls suddenly on Julian doing this depression affected his work.In Mexico Julian meets Danny a type whose fate has gone from bad to worse after the death of his young son and she is in Mexico trying to urgently define a business to give stability lost his marriage; both engage in a small friendship and even Julian confesses to Danny his profession.Time later when Julian is definitely unable to do their work their heads try to settle it by which resorts to Danny, the only friend who never has tenidopara help make a last work to save his life...The grace of the film is the relationship of the characters and some dialogues of which are quite memorable, Brosnan does an excellent job shedding the image of James Bond, heretic tell me but for me it is the best James Bond that has ever existed you compar√© to Connery with toasted such Julio Iglesias who shouted "skin cancer". Finally the film is entertaining and fast even though it is not the type of humor of Scary Movie but is more oriented to the dialogues.</body>
