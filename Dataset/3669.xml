	<body>Very curious and entretenidísima British production, which combines to perfection pure comedy with the adrenalítico police action film.It is beautiful at all times, being full of jocular, hilarious, situations as well as stunning action scenes, very well shot all of them.The performers are great, with a great interpretive British cast, which covers practically all ages (around parade, as well as the main character, young duo, illustrious veteran performers such as the always excellent and commendable Billie Whitelaw, Jim Broadbent, Edward Woodward, or Anne Reid). They are that they have fun as nice, because their roles distilled socarronería.Effective staging of Edgar Whrigt, with an inventiveness in the gags already outperformed in "Zombies Party, another humorous film, this time from terror-comedia.And it seems that the good of Whrigt is has self-imposed remodel his conceptual style the various genera, being faithful and honest to them, but adding his particular comic universe. Why not talk of parody, as in reality, can be seen in the action scenes and above all, intrigue, and mystery, which is faithful to the genera addresses, impacting the Viewer if you wish, and putting him squarely in its rich universe.Thus, scenes of the murders have great force, and intrigue not only achieved is maintained throughout the film (Yes, something long in my opinion, is you could have cut by somewhere about ten minutes or so.), but that is expressing, achieving an attractive climax effortlessly up to the minute final, simply spectacular.In short, a good and beautiful film, very pleasant and like lovers of pure comedy, as the good fans to the police movies and action alike.As a curiosity, looking to IMDB I discover who plays the ex-girlfriend of the protagonist, Janine. I'm a piece, who say it!.</body>
