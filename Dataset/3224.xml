	<summary>Approved justito for a proposal that raises greater interest a priori that a posteriori, but contains certain elements that make it advisable, despite its many flaws.</summary>
	<body>The fact that a film is set in the Argentina of the early 20th century, is enough incentive to make a priori me striking. If Additionally one of the protagonists is Maribel Verdú, that woman's voluptuous curves and plump breasts that marked my childhood, the interest increases. The child of clay tells a story, say that real, of a small status from the beginning of the last century, which began to have visions of a killer series frightening to a neighborhood. The film recreates the atmosphere of a decadent area of a power by then emerging in detail. In a district worker, humble workers, there are several social levels, and through the streets marching from young people who are initiated into the pillaging until certain level entrepreneurs, passing by a police force that is unable to solve the murders. The film begins in a very interesting way, but it is hampered by gaps in the script, which will progressively diluted and focusing more towards the paranormal, disregarding the various subtramas that spelled out in a principle and that in the majority of cases they are leaving without giving them final nor output. Nothing to say of performances, correct although not outstanding, with the exception of a hieratic Daniel Freire, that despite its wide experience, seems that there are still traumatized from his participation in the serial that Harry Potter would call the series that can not be named, and who in Spain met with the name of Ana and seven. Little more than say a film that reaches an approved justito, although she had twigs to achieve something much better.</body>
