	<body>The fast that the facts occur is dizzying, 1 hour and 48 minutes in which case everything. We learned that Jane had died, ciclope finds her, dies, know new X-Men, go deeper into the history of the revived, war breaks out and they die "for free" two of the most important icons of this Marvel. definitely the pace of the movie I did not like at all, will solve things in a very cumbersome way and certainly the script leaves much to be desired.Well the effects as always and the scene of X that fascinates us and draws us, but my really not liked by what I explained earlier.Except Phoenix which is wonderful and your performance is to remove the hiccups and and and and aaaaaah I love it is end of Magneto, although some say that it is your imagination I me ilusiono thinking that disgusting vaccine is not "eternal" and its effects have just been pronto.porque.No mistake who would not like a man X? Ummm I almost orgasmizo think so, a being so wonderful and different from everything. I also bother me if they try to change me (and the system does not already?), no doubt I become a girl magnet, I am with him, I think in this release than any we see the "least bad" bad (mm brings me some reminiscencian to V for Vendetta, are bad, really bad? or they are a product of the environment in which operate?).All this leads me to think about possible men - X of our society, because any. to the best have no wings or throw fire, but they are distinguished from the rest by having something that makes them unique and special. However always there is someone who wants to "cure". Nobody here wants to heal, we like the concept X, we like to do differ? XDDD.</body>
