	<body>Jack Sparrow is back at it again and this time presents a new adventure in which again put his life in danger. Next to it, we find ourselves with Will Turner and Elizabeth (Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley) who already made us enjoy the first delivery, and who inevitably return to cross on the path of the fearless pirate, to the delight of the spectators.Dead man's chest does not differ much from the curse of the Black Pearl, so we find ourselves with the same mechanisms by which he enjoyed with his adventures will again do so on this occasion. It should be noted the figure of the evil Davy Jones, who has a large presence on the screen and helps to believe us everything that we're seeing. There is no objection in the technical sections, moreover, this new installment in the Visual is spectacular. Its purpose has been achieved and note. So we have no more to immerse ourselves in the depths of the ocean and wait to the Black Pearl we collect in this anticipated third part, which incidentally will conclude us this second, that very wisely (money is the money) has left us wanting to know what happens with Davy Jones and company.</body>
