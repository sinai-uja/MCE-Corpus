	<summary>Juno is the quota of independent in this awards season film, because the film itself has nothing to make descatar on the other.</summary>
	<body>For four years, always be has finished brewing an independent film between favorite face award in United States. Lost in Translation, between cups, Crash, good night and good luck, or little Miss Sunshine has been the most recent examples.In this year, representative of independent in the face of cinema to the Oscar has been Juno, and although it seems somewhat cruel such description, is the truth. This must be understood in its context, and is that very few times the awards and nominations are fair. At a glance, Juno can be seen as the typical film of adolescents or a realistic comedy and intelligent in the most pejorative sense of the term. The truth is that it is more the latter than the former, although there are a lot of common and topical sites, and a complete absence of intelligent humor in the screenplay by Diablo Cody. The script also highlights, surprisingly, by its kitsch and fussiness, both in the development and evolution of blurred characters and their language. Jason Reitman has lost the acid and biting vision demonstrated in thank you for smoking, and adheres to the prudish and idealized vision of American society that offers the screenplay by Diablo Cody (the sequence in the Association pro abortion is just sonrojante). For its part, Ellen Page, however making an interpretation of the most natural, lively and fresh, does not justify the nomination has won the Oscar.Juno Award is the quota of independent in this awards season film, because the film itself has nothing to make descatar on the other. It is a hybrid between the typical comedy of teenagers and a high comedy full of irony and subtlety.</body>
