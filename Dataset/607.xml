	<body>Great película-denuncia of Michael Winterbotton and Mat Whitecross.Se could classify as documentary fiction, and let me explain. "Road to Guantanamo" part of a real event of the innocent voyage of four friends from England to Pakistan in September 2001, to attend the wedding of one of them, as they are first taken prisoner by the Northern Alliance and later by the Americans. This is a fact that step. Leave real people being interviewed, and in the end. But the recreation of the facts is fiction, they are four actors playing with Mise en scène. And it manages a denunciation film hard, dry and aggressive. Sales of the film thinking that your problems are less than nothing, and you open a little bit your eyes in this inhumane and consumerist society.The film goes in line with the work that I like most about Winterbotton, "In This World" (5), but without his poetry here dispenses with her to go straight to the point, to denounce. And as much as I dislike "In this World", comparisons are odious. And it is because "In this World" I think one of the best films of the last decade, invariably essential. "Road to Guantanamo" accomplishes its far, although the impact is me in the short term, perhaps is that the depth of "Saraband" do not leave me. But it is highly recommended.</body>
