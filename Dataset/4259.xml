	<body>Correct although foreseeable horror film of the 1980s which has many parallels with diabolical attraction of great Rosemary. The issue of the scientist that sort you of an experiment is treated for the umpteenth time by RICHARD FLANKLIN who had already excelled in the genre with the far superior PATRICK or the second part of psychosis. Performers include two very succulent with a girl names ELISHABETH SHUE that years most afternoon jumped to stardom by LEAVING LAS VEGAS and the always great TERENCE STAMP seen in recent years in productions of all kinds as PRISCILLA or Falcon English.The film it costs take off despite showing forward thanks to the behaviour of the animals that are the real stars of the function.When it enters in the field does not end to find the path of anguish, it seems that it is you could have gotten much more juice to the script because it leaves a vacuum in the Viewer.Anyway good performances, fantastic views, either in its technical aspects from photography to music and elegant decor.</body>
