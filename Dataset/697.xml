	<body>This same have later been in the cinema watching this film. Once again turn tales of animation for all ages to cargrse to the paternal or maternal figure, which does not seem too correct being viewing by young children, but in the end we're going to do, all blame Bambi.Partiendo that history tries to transmit the values given by others and thinking on others rather than oneselfthe idea that animals take human skills when humans don't realize it is original. What it is not entirely clear is the cisco form with the cattle. On the one hand we have a handful of cows that have lost the horns, so either terneritos or cow adult. For more auction is that cows can be males (as the protagonist of the story, Otis, a very male cow that is walking around on two legs with their udders hanging and if horns) or females that is normal.On the basis of which we can make a mess to the more small to close to cows, Bulls, the horns and the animals can walk on two legs, I think it is worth going to see it with them if only to see the faces of surprise, laughter and his gestures when appears the evil coyote.</body>
