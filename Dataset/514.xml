	<body>When I saw the poster hesitate what were these bugs on which flies the protagonist. Once completed it, not be if they are dragonflies or bees or wasps. More sinister aspect, since then.The film is a young child who is marginalized in your neighborhood by a bully and his Schleifer's henchmen. In addition to this, he has a family that does not support, what add you in the ostracism. You only have fun disturbing all the insects that can, in particular to a giant nest in your garden. What he doesn't know is that ants are preparing to fight so giant aggressor.Well, I must say that I liked, as almost all the animation. The script is quite childish, very dotted with moral respect details to others, even though they are smaller, and that the Union is strength. At the level of technical, because as always, amazing. The plot follows too well, and there are no shocks or scares. Everything follows the channels must continue. What happens is that it is too similar to many others, especially AntZ and even affection I have shrunk to children, what does lose a lot.In short, entertainment for the kids of the House, which can be seen by adults. Although if they learn the values that show us, the world would it spin better.</body>
