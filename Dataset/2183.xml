	<body>Woody returns to perform one of his comedies, in his style, as always, it is not a great film, and in some moments bored, but leaves a good taste for the moments of hilarious comedy, fostered by the performance of Allen, although it does always the same character not tired, moreover, already showed us a few years after that it is a great filmmaker seriously with the magnificent Match Point. Do in this film Allen charge against Hollywood producers, actors, agents? all are victims of his acid humor, something that is appreciated because the brightest Woody Allen is found in those moments of acidity that we enjoyed in many of his films. The parallelism between the reality and the fiction is evident, for example, the setting of the protagonist by the foreign directors of photography, something that also happens to Woody Allen. The fact that hires his girlfriend as an actress even though it is very bad acting, as it was the case with Mia Farrow?In this way, not only attacking the entire film industry in general, but also portrays himself as a director and as a person. Perhaps in this film are missing more ingenious dialogues which characterize his other films, so at various times the film decays and this makes an irregular film, although it is always advisable to see a Woody Allen film, because either of the worst of his filmography or the best, we will always find great moments and dialogs that are worthwhile.</body>
