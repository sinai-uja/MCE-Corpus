	<summary>Left me with nausea two hours after leaving the room, this makes her a good movie?</summary>
	<body>If it were forced to fozar a moral of this film would be as follows: the lack of control is usually expensive. Of course that Americans Paxton and Josh (Jay Hernandez and Derek Richardson) and the Finnish Oli, not imagined that the price would be so high. Touring Europe arrive in Amsterdam where, after days of drugs and sex nights, known to another tourist, who shows them a few photos taken with your mobile, where looks it in bed surrounded by women of Slovakia, who, according to him, are all beautiful and easy, especially when it comes to American tourists.This reference do you not think a second, take a train to the next day and staying in a hostel recommended to them by the same guy. There are two girls (one Russian, another Czech) willing to everything and more. "All" is obvious but it is up to the "more" reveal it in the peíìcula and not in a review of the same. I am only obliged to prevent to the impressionable who should refrain from submitting to this film. Because that is what makes the story: submitted to the Viewer, who does not want to and at the same time cannot help but look at some of the more violent scenes that I ever have seen, and I am not referring to psychological violence but violence that splatters blood off the screen.Eli Roth (new director for these payments), with a small little help of Tarantino, I submitted to my also and still left me with nausea, two hours after leaving the room. This makes her a good movie? Not necessarily, but certainly it is very effective and complies with its purpose. Recommended.</body>
