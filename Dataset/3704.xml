	<body>The relationship between husbands and wives is once again the focus of another notable comedy that many described as immoral. It was not for less, with their particular humor Wilder played with two antagonistic Archetypes of male imagery: the wife and the bitch. In order to ingratiate himself with the famous singer Dino (Dean Martin), the piano teacher Orville contractual prostitute Polly (Kim Novak), makes passing through his wife and delivery to your guest, waiting to be affected positively with the purchase of his songs. Meanwhile, Felicia, the wife, expelled from his home on pretexts, sticking a drunk at the bar rake "The navel" and ends up sleeping in the trailer of Polly, giving rise to a fun confusion of roles.</body>
