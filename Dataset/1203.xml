	<summary>It is made with an exquisite taste that despite a topic like sex, I assure you that at any time there are rudeness and boorishness.</summary>
	<body>One of the most promising comedians from the quarry of the American Saturday Night Live, Steve Carell (seen in the first part of "How God" and future star of its sequel, "Haunted" and "melinda and melinda").We certainly have one of the comedies of the year, not only by the blows of humor, that is and also great, but because I believe that for the first time after a long time we can enjoy a comedy as well as having humor has a good script, which is that with this film you not only enjoy the typical joke, but they enjoy during the hour and 50 minutes lasting film.And it is these films come out from time to time. It could even compare it with great comedies that we all know as "Farewell single" or "Gigolo", because this comedy is sincere, there are situations that any guy feel identified, because it has elegance, because it is sophisticated, and because it is made with exquisite taste, that despite a topic like sex, I assure you that at any time there are rudeness and boorishness.</body>
