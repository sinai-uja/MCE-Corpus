	<summary>The independent film back in luck, sensational work of direction in a history of those who like both with final moral.</summary>
	<body>The firm intention to be something more serious in terms of my viewing of film, and something more demanding, that does not mean that continue not watching cinema commercial (palomitero) which I like to see and then criticize, but try also to somehow my taste (and yours) towards some kind of movies that I've done this year (of which still carry few days), otherwise, would go completely unnoticed.This is the case of Juno, an independent film has not gone unnoticed, it has raised a whopping $70,862,478, and is that you know that in the States all the Indie movie fan aesthetics (we know what makes the Fox Division: Fox Searchlight Pictures) is always to the liking of the "americanitos of a foot" (I like calling my them), and although premiered December 5, (in Spain its premiere scheduled for early February) and has an excellent cast, where we have the jovencisima Ellen Page (a revelation that we have seen in "Hard Candy" and "X-Men 3), seconded by Michael Cera (of the best of"Supersalidos"), Jason Bateman (the" mutant""Mr Magorium") and Jennifer Garner ("Alias"series)(, "Elektra".), in addition to the remarkable direction from Jason Reitman, the son of the myth of the 80's Ivan Reitman, amazed to own and strangers with "Thank you for not smoking", has made USA an excellent taste, besides a few nominations to the Academy Awards.The beginning of the film reminds me much other films of the same court, go no further that crappy that was "American Splendor", and is that, like any good movie Indie must warn him since the first min. footage, is not that you one then starts to see the movie and wondering where noses have been the director the explosions, the naked integrals and extreme violence; Once granted the bases tape, which today brings us, lost by other byways, we take into account that the script runs through the former-striper Diablo Cody, nominated for an Oscar for this reason.While the story is somewhat linear (4 seasons and what that happens), maybe the tape is, in my view, the interpretation of Page sobervia, which gives life to this excentrica and vivacious Juno, which neither silent none of which thinks, nor cut hair to make, not just what comes it in WINS, but also make things very clear everyone, and is, as they used to say out there, with 16 years already it can be (or not) very well furnished head.The independent film back in luck, sensational work of direction in a history of those with final moral like that, especially recommended to all those facing paternity (responsible or irresponsible) or those who with 16 years believe that they have little to do and nothing to live.</body>
