	<summary>The intention has been to do something mystical plan and the result is a shit worthy of producing the largest of the somnolencias before viewing.</summary>
	<body>The other day I had the brilliant idea of seeing this movie and narrowly not dying of fright to see such garbage.It is amazing as it may occur in Spain this type of pointless movies. Santi Amodeo paste the blunder directing a movie heavy to say enough is enough. Crappy up to despair and a direction of actors that makes you want to vomit. Adriana is a piece of (poorly exploited) actress is well below its potential and Juan José Ballesta, much to my regret because I love, paste the greater petardazo of his career playing this absurd role in plan "I want and I can not" be a deep and mystical character.Here I have the impression that was intended to do something mystical plan and that the result is a shit worthy of producing the largest of the somnolencias before viewing. Comment also the complete lack of feeling between the two actors. Juan José not help anything to Adriana, noticeable to the League.Sometimes I regret that it is not able to give negative scores, this film is worth to be punctuated with a - 5 stars.The light, photography, screenplay, locations, everything sucks so badly.Do not waste your time and save yourself some nausea deep.</body>
