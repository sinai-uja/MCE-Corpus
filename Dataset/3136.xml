	<body>Very nice film, beautifully directed by Gracia Querejeta (simple but masterly form of cut scenes) and superbly performed. Now that you know that he has won at the recent International Festival of cinema of Donostia 2007 Award for best screenplay, it is easy to say that it has a very well-written idem, but the truth is that it is. It perfectly combines drama with humor, perhaps winning the latter, but rather by the sympathy and entrañabilidad of his very well profiled characters, as the Fund is predominantly dramatic. A drama with the paternal figure present at all times (a constant film of Querejeta), now defunct physically, but that pulula, hurting and struggling with the happiness of their relatives. Painful memories, accounts pendienes not yet been overcome, vivid memories of tenderness and sadness, are present, without that seems easy to leave them behind. Good dialogues, especially the protagonist couple: Maribel Verdú-Blanca Portillo (this marvelous, with great naturalness in his declamations and an overflowing humanity in his character, Amen of hilarious scenes as of the Chinese, humorous and hilarious, restaurant make you share laughter). True is what was said at the time during the Festival, it sometimes seems that it tends to how easy, making everything fits to seem more friendly and more liked by the public, but the truth is that love and leaves very good taste. For my taste, and simply as entertainment, the best of the official section of the competition.</body>
