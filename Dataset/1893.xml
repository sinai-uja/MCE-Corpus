	<summary>Nothing remarkable: star dust, dusty, many stars, long guitar riff and long rush of adrenaline rock.</summary>
	<body>There is nothing new under the Sun or in a cinema seat: 9 songs have already seen. Does news: uses the width and bombastic background of references in the history of the cinema and formulates a hypothetical media scandal abating as soon as one really weighs the degree of provocation of its proposal.Winterbottom is rupture far left to be routine, reformer of an already existing speech that had their beautiful peak in the late 1960s and early 1970s: flower power, hippies, guitar riffs and subidones of LSD to synchronize the body with the free spirit of the songs cosmos.9 is sex, drugs and rock and roll. Missing Ian Dury. Moreover, there is here a stubborn advocacy of the skin as almost unique vehicle for communication between a couple. The speech underground, indie or like call has points of collapse everywhere because (perhaps) this is not a movie, or at least one film in the way that I understand the films, but a hybrid curious, boring, electric moments and, in the end, disappointing documentary about stars on stage rock and hardcore eroticism (or the softcore).If I put the MTV and see a concert of Black Rebel Motorcycle Club or Franz Ferdinand (whose records have) it would not be worse time. This time, at least I saw in dvd format and didn't have to get out of the bad-tempered film.</body>
