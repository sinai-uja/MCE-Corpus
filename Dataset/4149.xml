	<summary>The idea of a few young boys who fall in love and those who like to steal together is not new, but it can take much advantage, although in the case of this film has not been.</summary>
	<body>Juan José Ballesta plays a kid who just came out of a reception centre and you have to search for life, but all that know-how is stealing, his mother taught him to do so before they stopped her when he was a child. His life changes when she meets Sara (Maria Valverde) a girl from a wealthy family that engaged in a relationship.The idea of a few young boys who fall in love and those who like to steal together is not new, but it can take much advantage, although in the case of this film has not been. In part by the flat performance of the protagonist, Juan José Ballesta, although her praises much for his interpretations I can't see in it anything that I like, when you have the weight of the film this is boring, Maria Valverde is the only thing that animates a little action, why the best moments of the film arise when she appears and stolen togetherIt is the only thing exciting, that the plot of the mother of the protagonist is not very successful.Everything is very slow in this film, since the beginning, slow motion, an unnecessary effect, because that same scene could have resolved in less time and more easily and would have been even more intense. The rest of the film is not in slow motion, but it is almost as if out, if you miss a NAP when you wake up not you've lost it nothing.</body>
