	<summary>With times ashamed to himself Johnny Knoxville, Borat is a movie so fucking as necessary. A hilarious insult.</summary>
	<body>The personality of the year is Borat Sagdiyev, a beloved Kazakh reporter going to California and U to discover the american way of life and apply in your country / village. Filmed almost entire documentary style, Borat brings to light the (infinite) miseries of la peña that surrounds him, (in Kazakhstan and EEU and U), to stick the finger nail on while causing terrible attacks of laughter in the spectator, which is descojona by the unlimited capacity of Cohen to provoke and because he knows that people are (we are) soa shit (as told in due course after seeing Dogville) with moments that ashamed at himself Johnny Knoxville, Borat is a movie so fucking as necessary. A hilarious insult. A 8.PD: full absolute in rooms v.o.s. "cool", of those that are still projecting the gardener or Munich, takes pitch.</body>
