	<summary>Straight music, no life, body, or brightness. Fails to emit that assumption good vibes that intended to convey, rather just aborreciendo to each and every one of his characters and wishing to, please, stop once to ridicule.</summary>
	<body>It is not to bring the opposite to the flood of positive reviews it has received "Hairspray", but to me this film has left me an aftertaste to impossible to hide disappointment.Bad songs and good intentions that fall on deaf ears is what gives us this film who, following the current trend of making films for the just cause, claimed conditions of equality between ethnic groups far from the world, both in the 1960s as today, is able to digest. We must not forget the controversial proclamation pro-obesidad that spreads, among others, the female character played by a weary enough Travolta, who is unable to articulate a single sentence in the entire film that does not contain any mention of food.In my opinion, "Hairspray" fails to issue this alleged good vibes that intended to convey, rather just aborreciendo to each and every one of his characters and wishing to, please, stop once to ridicule. Although still more scrupulous, the argument for ridiculous: typical girl that would never elect for the dance of graduation that dreams of being dancer despite the obstacles, without more.And, unfortunately, as with "Caótica Ana", nothing positive to highlight of this film.</body>
