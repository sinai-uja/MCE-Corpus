	<summary>A tape to be revisit to see the history of animation, from one Prism less critical and more passionate, and is that we create or not, all of pixar this into our hearts.</summary>
	<body>Now, thanks to the "Ratatouille" DVD I have been compiling little by little Pixar films, I decided to revisit the tape of John Lasseter, certainly the tape, will meet 10 years the next year, has lost some of the luster that animation is concerned, which is that the animation of the ants, mind-bogglingly before now achieved remains sad and plastic; you have to see what progress has been made the animation (and digital effects) in this period of time; In addition, the effects of water, tapes as "Cars" or "Ratatouille" (the most recent) or even in "The Incredibles" or "Buscando a Nemo".Although the history, message, quite well achieved has not lost bellows (maybe this "buenrollo" Disney that drive all tapes of Pixar) and I like to think, or believe that perhaps someday will Pixar make a tape that does not end with the Happy End we are accustomed.On the other hand, characters have enough charisma so that each one can choose his favorite from ladybug, until the flea, passing through the Woodlice, ants or the evil grasshoppers.In short: A tape to be revisit to see the history of animation, from one Prism less critical and more passionate, and is that we create or not, all of pixar this into our hearts.</body>
