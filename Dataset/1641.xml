	<body>With almost two years of delay, and after being released on DVD, it releases a very minority form Edmond. To talk about this film, the first thing next to one to the head is a question, and simple why not her has directed David Mamet? Not only is to be given by insurance, nor her put one of his fetish actors, nor that it involved his wife, but that in addition to having written the screenplay, it is based on a play by the author himself.Edmond (William H. Macy) is a normal, grey, man who has a good job and has been married for several years. One night, Edmond realizes of how empty is his life and his marriage, which has just abandoned his wife and his quiet life with her. The film chronicles a descent into hell of a man and like that man is facing their fears that in turn are their most unspeakable desires. The power and intensity of the script by David Mamet are more than tangible, though not as the address. Debutant Stuart Gordon does not finish done with history, and the scale of the work of Mamet comes big. The pace is somewhat slow, although the short duration of the film is that it does not suffer too much. This great actor named William H. Macy is immense in its role, giving his character of a great emotional register. Beside they parade usual film of Mamet, as his wife Rebecca Pidgeon, as well as young performers such as Mena Suvari, Julia Stiles, Dulé Hill or Denise Richards, doing very good work.</body>
