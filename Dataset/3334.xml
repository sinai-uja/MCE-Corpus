	<summary>Another of these continuations meaningless, where attempts to mix mythology with science and classic horror, and just getting mediocrity, aburrimieno and predictability.</summary>
	<body>If I have no remedy. Even though I say I won't swallow movies that Intuit will always be a crappy at the end just watching everything I gets ahead; and of course, with this lack of criterion that I admit that I sometimes dominates, as it happens what happens.Perhaps is that I start now one of my criticisms shorter for this space so beloved that is for me Muchocine, but precisely because of that love I feel by this place on the network, I do not want wasting their space littering it with words about the mediocrity of this aberration I took today.Return to house on Haunted Hill is a bad sequel to a film that already by itself was a bad remake of the classic of terror that back in the year 1958 he directed William Castle, and which attracted assets, among others, Vincent price and Richard Long.Como would say the great Tito Chin-Chan, is little more than guts, ROAR, and liters of ketchup parading across the screen. Nothing notable in the interpretation, or an evil wink to its predecessors in the script. Nothing at all.Tremendously obscure scenarios, absence of sub-plots of interest and multiple defects of filming, screenplay and post-production, is the only thing that occurs to me highlight this transatlantic chestnut that I has crept in surreptitiously between tapes had planned for these days where the trouble with despair and apathy my last moments of holidays that have known unless nothing.</body>
