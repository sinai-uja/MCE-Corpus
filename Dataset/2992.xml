	<body>This week that on a personal level what are not going too well, we wanted to go to the cinema to disconnect and perhaps the best way to leave the concerns for a while was a musical comedy, "Hairspray" had all the ballots for that, for letting us enjoy with its history, its music and its cast for 90 minutes.Honestly the tape get, and not just one happens throughout the film "half bailoteando" under the seat, but that also the great music, where any, so well accompanies the actors on screen, that does not understand a thing without the other, logical, clear, we have a musical, one of the most famous of Broadway.La history, all integration from beginning to endwhere a girl entradita in kilos (though beautiful in all the aspects, newcomer Nikki Blonsky) seeks to eliminate racial segregation, racist 1960s in Baltimore (USA), accompanied by Blonsky, John Travolta, as his mother, perhaps the least I liked, and is, unfortunately not I have been able to separate the idea every time you saw him appear on screen that was thatJohn Travolta in disguise, has its merit dancing in that suit, and move the way it moves, but I say, could not separate the idea and instead of seeing Edna saw Travolta regalia.The rest of the cast comprises it a staff of most amazing, from Michelle Pfeiffer, incredible as villain role, and that has not lost one iota of its beauty or charm sexy on screen, Amanda Bynes, one of the Queens of the romantic comedy today, Queen Latifah who already sang in Chicago's Rob MarshallChristopher Walken, parked his serious roles and giving a cool touch of comedy, his dancing with Travolta will be among the remembered scenes of the film for years, James Marsden "Código" of X-Men, which embarrasses me admit that he sings wonderfully and danced also excellently well and Zac Efron, already a famous face of the musicals through the television phenomenon "High School Musical".Adam Shankman manages to harness track, after a full career of romantic comedies and tapes without too much film interest with this friendly and at the same time amazing music, leaving the narrative weight of tape and in music the approach that a good feature of these features need in his actors.I think it shows very well that I loved, so I I do not alargaré more than enough properly, you're happy and cheerful, cinema in addition to humming the successes of the soundtrack, it is not only recommended, it is necessary, to brighten the face in the times in which we are, with both disgust and roll in our lives.</body>
