	<summary>A pity as well hyped idea ends up going to "hell" by a development helpings</summary>
	<body>When I read articles that on the film had been published of Luc Besson, I found that it stated (on several occasions) the total originality of the tape, and not do tributes to any previous tape; and, sadly Mr Besson was lying which bellaco, since not only the characters seem to be an updated version of the "Crystal Black", but that there are also references to a hundred movies, "Pulp Fiction" which makes him at least 3 tributes in the footage, ranging from "Fever of the Saturday night" or any than anything else of tapes as "Count on me" "The Goonies" or even the "Indiana Jones" series, so that Besson, better not go originals and have a little decency not to discover "the coca-cola formula".Another negative note parties are errors, one fat stroke since and without disclosing nothing of the plot, could be revised a little script for not staying in evidence.On the other hand, is a pity that, so well hyped idea (the initial premise for a child tape is the suitable), end going to "hell" by development helpings, and in some cases very little efectistas, pity of so accomplished animation (some characters come to be endearing), fails to come to fruition the tape, and sinks to leaps towards a rather than abrupt end.</body>
