	<summary>The new film directed by Sean Penn is guilty of some bombast and proclaim a message something superflúo, but its plastic beauty is simply undeniable.</summary>
	<body>Directed by Sean Penn and starring Emile Hirsch, Vince Vaughn, Marcia Gay Harden, William Hurt, Kristen Stewart, Catherine Keener, Hal Holbrook, Zach Galifianakis, Haley Ramm and Jena Malone, towards wild routes is nominated for an Academy Award for the best supporting Actor and best Montaje.Basada the work of Jon Krakauer, into wild routes (Into the wild) tells the story of the young and idealistic Christopher McCandlesswho leaves his life in civilization, left their possessions and donate their savings to charity $24,000 to direction to the Alaska Wild under the name Alexander Supertramp.Con lasting almost two hours and a half, towards wild routes is a film that possesses great successes and, at the same time, terrible errors: on the one hand we have an appealing storya kind of initiatory journey in search of the real I from the break with society.The truth is that this break does not nothing new, neither in literature nor in the celluloid world, because there are dozens and dozens of examples in which the flight is to be the starting point for the discovery of the true individual, but one must admit that the Sean Penn film chooses to give greater emphasis to the plastic to the own message.With a voice-over in the mouth of the sister of Chris dropping tiresome maxims of self-help books, more metaphysical in search of the theatrical, limited to interact esporádicamene to its protagonist with all kinds of characters in an overly sweetened wisdom Exchange is dismissive of your message to wild routes.On the other hand, we have a film fraught with lengthy close-ups tomas air carried out by Eric Gautier who, as they have said in more than one place, occasionally believe watching an endless car ad, but whose aesthetic beauty is simply undeniable. And it is that, on the one hand, well are you can reproach Sean Penn having made a film superflúa, childish and somewhat Manichean in many respects, but reproach both photography and the Assembly work is something stupid, at least in my view. Obviously, there is a clear abuse of such panoramas, especially when the main character appears in its framing doing push-ups, climbing, fishing, walking or stir to spectacular sunrises, as if this is intended to show the spirit of freedom that the script has been unable to translate, but out of context, to wild routes photography is simply wonderful.In this way, towards wild routes is a film of plastic indescribable beauty, but weak script, in which its protagonist never comes to sympathize with the Viewer, because their motivations, however, we seem more own the whim that some incontrovertible truths. But, on the other hand, is also true that the motivations it each which are always subjective and, occasionally, incomprehensible and unjustifiable for others, erecting the very act of realization as a main motivation and merit to the detriment of all reasoning, so I understand, either by a mere teenager whim or by a genuine quest for inner peacethe story of Christopher McCandless is commendable.</body>
