	<body>Weak pulse, alien to the film made him have a name on the payroll of filmmakers with ideas (Tigerland, falling down or customer), Schumacher added another fiasco to the inventory of fiasco leads to slopes. If notable are mental holes of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, to name but 2 of the most sound and unfortunately recordables, we now have the number 23, more than proof talent dissipates just like a carbonated drink exposed to the warm sun of the morning on a balcony. The craftsman has become operator and the interesting Crassus worker director. This new approach to the supernatural, theme that is pleasant already from its promising beginnings (flatliners, lost boys) is nothing more than a quirky and trumpeter triples conjecture argument chabacanamente developed from what, in other hands, another enthusiastically, could have given a decento film.It is the comic, say, of the ordinary man in a man that a dog bites or cartoon of a man that is reflected in a book that suspiciously brings his childhood and relevant recurrence of a number, bloody 23, that he haunts in the fringes of the summer and the coffee-grounds. Jim Carrey, so outstanding in other recent tapes (the Truman show, forget me) now I think a comedian in a slapstick with a veneer of seriousness. And it isn't serious. It is bad.This inconsistent, trite, twisted and deslavazado monstrosity of film around a number has disappointed me so much and I have suffered so much with the time spent in the recognition of my error I will not write more.</body>
