	<body>Perhaps not understood her... I had heard interesting things of this film by the disappointment was even greater after discovering that it was that kind of films where he is apparently going to happen something very funny and not nothing happens, one of the films most frustrating that I have seen and the worst thing is I do not remember having laughed at any time only spreads smiles from time to time. Even worse is the fact that has a good cast with actors who have made good comedies and that therefore one expects something more than half-finished characters and nonsensical.Waiting aims to be one of those comedies more close to the style of Porky? s, however alleged gags are not even original funny. The film tells the story of a group of young people working in a restaurant, so we have excuses to see scenes of fluids in the meals of the unpleasant clients, but nothing that has not been; Perhaps the only thing original is the game that practiced the characters that is mutually show genitals in a surprising way, however after a while it no longer has much grace.As I said the characters are vaguely written, only in the case of the character of Justin Long, a boy that faces at the decision to continue his life working in the restaurant or do anything else, seems to be more defined but not even that?.In short Waiting is a bad comedy and worst of all is an opportunity malgastada to do something interesting and really funny. Do not lose time. A star.</body>
