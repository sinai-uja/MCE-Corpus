	<body>Good film, which has its dark visual package as more hangover, giving the feeling, possibly because that is, of trying to thus show that it is a completely independent film. I do not think that you would lack prove it because the divesos elements that compose the tape amply demonstrate it. Some excellent but little-known performers (with the exception of Gosling, who has already demonstrated abundantly good do in his impeccable and very difficult role in "The believer"), a first-time director and a history of clearly social dyes that usually is not the safest genus commercially speaking.The film exudes credibility thanks to a competent script, not accentuating allegedly tear stains, which could well have appeared in one or two scenes. Containment, both formal and gestural of the performers is its best asset, making Ryan Fleck, its young director, that human and hard history being imposed on empty aesthetic issues that improve the visual aspect of the tape, but that it would negatively impact on the realism of the film."A clear, concise, film that may have some fall of rhythm and some point somewhat sparse, but which also contains excellent scenes, such as the two holidays together, the family of the protagonist and"other family"of the young co-star, or the scene in which Drye must take drugs a home, encountering his teacher in it.""Half Nelson" is a better film than any experienced director should have taken certainly a greater slice but considering that it is the first film of its young Director, it must be said that it is very decent, entertaining and exudes credibility.</body>
