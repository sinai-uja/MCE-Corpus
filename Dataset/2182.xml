	<body>Closer is a very realistic movie about relationships, usually films dealing with this kind of items sell us things that are lies, however, this film is as the same, sad and hard life.Dialogs have an impressive force, everything is based on them, all the sexual content of the film is in the dialogues, they are intense and so real that at any time the Viewer may feel that he has lived this situation. For the first time spoken clearly and plainly sex in a serious dialogue in the film, finally an adult film about love.The four protagonists are at the height of the story, amazed Julia Roberts, as we are accustomed to seeing in another type of lighter than this film. Here it shows that really know interpret beyond the romantic comedies and proves better than in Erin Brokovich, although an oscar will be for that film.Jude Law conveys much with his eyes and Natalie Portman outboard his role as enigmatic and at the same time fragile girl. Clive Owen plays the role of a dermatologist you bastaste rude and brusque, incidentally, the voice that fold you in Spanish seems a bit painful, is too neutral, after seeing her in folded, and original version I think it loses enough with dubbing.In short, Closer is a highly recommended film for the richness of its characters.</body>
