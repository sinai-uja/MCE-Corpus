	<summary>Void narration where the 20 minutes you know everything that will happen, accompanied by a surprise ending that causes only the general messing.</summary>
	<body>Let's see! When in a horror movie you have to fear is a fucking doll that seems the fucking MACARIO wrong walk, what truly gives dread is that anytime leave happily José Luis moreno.The creator of SAW a cheater film made by the grace of it is not known who in one of the most successful works of the current film shows what many presagiamos. Something as simple as his enormous mediocrity does not know narrating an interesting script at any time. Sounds of volume a toda mecha, interpreters that they should not leave school of interpretation. With face of stick walking el inútil de DONNIE WAHLBERG "SAW 2" painful but beautiful actress AMBER VALLETTA "seen on HITH" in site of panic seems part, thing totally understandable because banter has the assassins.This issue was previously discussed in very enjoyable films like infernal dolls "MAGIC" here is literally torn one-way flat, a non-existent narrative where the 20 minutes you know everything that will happen, accompanied by a surprise ending that causes only the general messing.</body>
