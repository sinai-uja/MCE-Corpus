	<body>From that I have not seen the original film, although I do not know why this drew me enough attention (perhaps by the attractive presence of Marisa Tomei and Susan Sarandon, in addition to Law, of course), and while in some moments I've had quite some complicity with "Alfie" know that the Femina can feel insultadas in his egotism and his nose. As a "Alfie" would be female version? Although eventually it ends up being a "Hunter hunted" the film promises more fun and more depth than just finally giving and although proceedings are sober and well undertaken, especially that of Jude Law, the film seems a guide tourist of NY (city by very cinematic Excellence).By the way, Sienna Miller, the new couple of Law, previously married to Sadie Frost (which has his name tattooed)!This very but very good!Finally, a film with which the boys spend a good time and the girls while they enjoy the presence of Law they will look at your partner with certain side of "bad grapes".</body>
