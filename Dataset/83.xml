	<summary>A very entertaining movie to see youth-minded</summary>
	<body>These things of superpowers have always I hallucinated. That prefer, elastic man or superfuerza? Depends on the time, right? Although from a purely sexual point of view, I believe that I have clear, very clear, heh, heh.The film is about a kid son of major superiors who has known history, the Commander and Supersónica. This will be the first year that enters the Institute of superheroes and is very distressed. On the one hand, his father giving him grilled and overshadowing him completely. On the other hand, still has no superpowers and believes that he is going to ridicule. This new Institute, becomes a natural selection, heroes and curritos (helpers of the hero, type Robin with Batman). And the first humiliate seconds.Well, that most surprising film. I warn that we must see it with teenage mentality, not with mentality of cincuentón bearded Lord who supports the Mahou in the belly while scratches the scrotum with your free hand. It is a film for youth or children's minds. I saw clearly two similar, "The incredible" and "Harry Potter". The first, by the subject of the family superpowers. The second, on the issue of students, superpowers, bad, good, teachers, etc. To highlight the soundtrack, which is pretty funky and in keeping with the film. The actors have currado and history, though ultimately unoriginal hooked enough. The best of the film is the scene of selecting currito and heroes (great similarities to the Harry Potter Sorting Hat). As default, it becomes a little bit long, especially in the time of love.</body>
